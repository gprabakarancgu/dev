00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.120
I can open.

e6c32d3f-5d9c-4a66-815d-a8f993d396a2-0
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.560
I, I OK, have I think let me open that.

fbc6cf69-b58d-4675-969e-a01da9282b1a-0
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.840
Just give me a minute to share.

c4ddbfd6-84da-4e2e-b6f2-e8ece70cc32e-0
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.280
Can you guys see my screen?

bad0bde0-61d8-431e-b833-3a40113d2cc4-0
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.040
Yeah.

93c91efc-bdc8-4438-8494-d5ffcfb0db57-0
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.880
OK.

e265bb7c-3ccb-4447-a8b6-48f2c0840320-0
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.160
Let me open David.

07f2f064-37a1-43ce-85b5-5be8d7902865-0
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.521
I think what's happening in the event if
you go to the portal and the sign button

07f2f064-37a1-43ce-85b5-5be8d7902865-1
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.360
is already there, right.

2f2ec457-ac54-4f30-a903-6595ff978c04-0
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.067
I think it's happening because it's not
fully BTC is fully not configured,

2f2ec457-ac54-4f30-a903-6595ff978c04-1
00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:41.960
but there's couple of settings that we
need to delete.

899791cd-0fe2-4d9f-a289-8eb133bff148-0
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.960
That's what I was trying to delete the
other day, right?

e1ee4c59-1bca-4a8a-beca-2f4390841265-0
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.360
Yep.

17be794a-f392-4f03-9d44-d2b2f090d768-0
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.200
Those two settings makes portal things.

aa7c5e6b-53ba-4466-97c1-eddba0d904d9-0
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.680
It has BTC, but it doesn't have BTC.

903c6ccf-03d3-4131-9a17-3ddee5d527e0-0
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.640
So I think we need to 1st delete those
two settings and deactivate it.

ccb925b9-ff03-4903-a7f1-a1dd15fa2420-0
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.160
Instead of deleting it,
shall we deactivate it?

2c5cdaff-a8b3-4e59-88fa-cf70b06f372f-0
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.520
Whatever.

29bd632c-1cc2-4f6c-b126-f6dd84c98f6a-0
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.120
Yeah, Yeah.

cb0eabd5-765b-474e-ac32-47bafd1bea4c-0
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.920
I don't know much about Portal.

ebccf597-8469-45bc-ba24-40014eddec56-0
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.460
So we need to yeah,
get portal to not to use those two

ebccf597-8469-45bc-ba24-40014eddec56-1
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.040
settings.

52640ccd-638f-4b49-846b-b47bb2db9d65-0
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.600
And just a quick thing Dinaga like, yeah,
we have Dev 02, right.

f3c55ff0-19ce-414b-85c8-8263b79ef8a8-0
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.339
It's going forward if they are asking us
to share whatever we are doing for dev

f3c55ff0-19ce-414b-85c8-8263b79ef8a8-1
00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:23.938
end,
we have to do the similar thing for Dev

f3c55ff0-19ce-414b-85c8-8263b79ef8a8-2
00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:24.400
02 also.

bf4f2610-6429-44f2-b101-3baf01ff5f0d-0
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.520
Yes, OK.

5d335fdd-7262-418b-b4cc-35e21222444b-0
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.200
Yes, we can use the Dev V to see.

30fd7417-ccf0-45f0-97aa-8b0c592b951c-0
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.314
And then so you need to work with Pradeep
and there's your team to get a Web API

30fd7417-ccf0-45f0-97aa-8b0c592b951c-1
00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:42.280
deployed into the Dev resource group in
Azure.

c188fc92-c3d2-42bc-a76b-a8f0c15da4ae-0
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.320
OK.

c77c7ed3-8d70-4209-8ee7-db181d966cd6-0
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.568
And then, yeah,
So then so whatever you done for Dev end,

c77c7ed3-8d70-4209-8ee7-db181d966cd6-1
00:01:47.568 --> 00:01:51.815
that needs to be done by Pradeep,
whatever the Azure side level and power

c77c7ed3-8d70-4209-8ee7-db181d966cd6-2
00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:56.120
pages side, whatever we are doing now,
we have to replicate it for Dev 02.

a218e14f-9f6f-4b2d-9024-59336c1c5ccf-0
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.080
Yes.

9bef051a-61c2-45c8-87ca-cd37a1892221-0
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.440
OK, So that's setting.

969d3d39-0f07-47d0-bd98-f67a4822c784-0
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.040
Yeah, yeah.

7e0d501c-47e0-445a-a8da-96636170ca6b-0
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.880
So copy that setting.

04408e60-03d5-4ce3-bdbf-7b3030b31ec5-0
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.120
We need to add that back, but temporary,
we'll delete it.

f139e1f6-8df0-4dd4-b114-62b7a096205b-0
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.360
So deactivate it,
you can activate it again.

45f4e225-ec64-4000-9aa4-8d20f760b268-0
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.280
K and values option.

847c451b-95ac-413f-9871-bbb7874a1b26-0
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.960
OK, deactivate.

d2a48280-9540-47a4-b5f3-aae8b54af418-0
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.025
And there's another setting called
registration button type,

d2a48280-9540-47a4-b5f3-aae8b54af418-1
00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:34.280
I think let's deactivate that as well.

55051d7c-d461-4dd2-b0e0-3bd533d0729f-0
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920
Yeah, that one there.

f0fb313a-fe35-4e5c-9ae4-ffda7e577289-0
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.840
This one.

226cbf60-6203-414c-8331-3955cb24848a-0
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.120
Yeah, there are two.

d0ddd7e4-ce21-4635-a481-f9a4a10a171b-0
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.360
The one is linked with our site,
so the other one, ignore it.

2c778dc5-f382-4ddb-9644-74e29bd6001e-0
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.680
Yeah, I'll copy this as well.

10d7af8c-80a3-4818-ad1d-9230a4318ebd-0
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.840
I don't think the setting is needed.

238ce721-2836-48c4-bf47-3dcfb50e27da-0
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.200
Just maybe deactivate it.

00e303b2-a6c9-46d0-ab7d-89f3452ad0a5-0
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.280
OK, Deactivate it.

a5d48831-264a-46d1-86f7-5f07518738ff-0
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.640
Yeah.

d97ab427-23e6-4133-979f-044d8ff4ce06-0
00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.240
All right.

1c8959a0-9067-46ac-b532-6af5d716baf5-0
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.682
So if you sync it now and if you go to
the browse the power portal,

1c8959a0-9067-46ac-b532-6af5d716baf5-1
00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:10.800
I expect that sign in to not work anymore
like OK, Yep, not not do anything.

ca78cd66-4451-4ea9-a380-18a962bf5046-0
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.690
Can we try browsing to it?

7c6100aa-b83f-449c-aa8a-d1c172c612ed-0
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.810
OK.

db4c3628-516f-41ff-9451-9eaadf04d363-0
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.120
OK, this one right, Yeah,
it's still showing the button.

383c81a7-6992-4f84-8f18-0979bdf53aa0-0
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.320
It's going to the local.

6e3ca100-dcb2-49af-b8b6-e3045d330c25-0
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.120
Yeah, yeah,
that because the sign in is enabled.

0e63e6f5-9aa1-4a40-a254-4744b66381fc-0
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.520
So it's Yep, now it's not going.

350cbd20-bd61-4f84-bda8-d3aeea2510fa-0
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.680
It was going to roam B to CURL before,
right?

c34e4f04-bdd5-4aae-b5de-4f998d12f6ca-0
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.200
Yep.

85b5acdb-4611-4942-a359-282e53789ae8-0
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.819
So now let's configure the B to C Can we
in another tab,

85b5acdb-4611-4942-a359-282e53789ae8-1
00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.760
can we open the dev instance?

c69f63ea-4d86-4f2d-9983-72bb1a8d5b4a-0
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.160
This one?

936592ff-50f9-4499-9cd1-74b1763cb77c-0
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.920
Yeah, dev instance.

34aa469f-03f1-4863-ab5f-033f2f91830e-0
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.200
So, so we can just start copying.

2f4463e1-98d6-4ca1-b2dd-c5bfb41e33eb-0
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.120
Stop.

5b9aec24-ffd2-4040-93ca-a39e4e1d30d5-0
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.920
OK.

d962c820-c0be-4e71-a696-3a4845d38f98-0
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.920
This is not not the not the settings.

2356fadb-a6e7-4753-8166-ae9c6e78e009-0
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.600
Yep.

0fbd04dc-8f8a-43d5-8fcc-82dbecc04b7b-0
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760
What do you call that?

e6531b83-50bc-491b-bc02-476ab0abb823-0
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.600
I don't know what that's called from make
power pages.

f6e7db95-6a60-4d65-a1f7-ddfffa29f273-0
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.360
You mean the power pages Studio?

241ef2a5-31c4-49e8-ba0e-991b392e08bb-0
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.920
Yeah, that that's one this one.

0cd2fb2b-cfbe-4bab-ba59-813acbcd67ce-0
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.600
Yeah.

f8cdfa4d-e340-40f1-9fb6-7d26bcd85947-0
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.360
Could you go to security?

9144e38b-66fd-41f3-9f10-884b1405854d-0
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.000
Security.

12f8a6be-52f7-4618-84c6-5963f88b4644-0
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.720
OK, There.

9455083e-effe-4714-a536-10f557fac2f1-0
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.240
So this is DEVINT, Right?

48d878b5-adfb-48c1-979e-71f04d65cff2-0
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.800
So this is Dev and this is DEVINT.

29fc9fa8-5ec1-4a63-8560-870368238415-0
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.680
Yeah.

3f1efc2a-18e1-4a4d-b802-20e79d5429a3-0
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.920
OK.

162297c7-3aaa-4279-b5ee-5dfda51cb19a-0
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.680
Keep them side by side.

c68e338b-c125-492a-bd21-aa594bc33d35-0
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.080
Yep.

9f6fe4c6-077b-469c-86b8-5db2f1bb6ce0-0
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.440
So dev int still shows that B to C
instance even though we deactivated it.

87879e12-bce9-46cc-9587-896c5d9e8bb9-0
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.120
It is not yet configured right?

1878bff4-2ed4-4db6-a962-10cf5c55af31-0
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.240
Yeah.

1fd83ea3-e0c1-4fb1-8a75-b34dd70195e4-0
00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:04.560
So I I was hoping it not to show here,
but anyway, let's try configuring it, OK,

1fd83ea3-e0c1-4fb1-8a75-b34dd70195e4-1
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:14.344
because I think it's still finding that
deactivator setting this one,

1fd83ea3-e0c1-4fb1-8a75-b34dd70195e4-2
00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:16.720
that one setting.

0d9290ea-ca90-4fe4-9123-ab245c11bd6f-0
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.280
Can you sync it Sindhu?

80f5b39a-78da-4383-ab9b-029d56ad3ca7-0
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.680
OK, probably that's the issue.

c35a6674-ffeb-4d7f-8ba4-329b4e0a52c5-0
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:29.700
OK, it's still there, but it's showing.

85f4cb4e-976d-45ac-bcc3-0074aa831988-0
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.140
Yep.

221301aa-ff8e-40ea-b244-97af57ef936b-0
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.540
OK, I'll configure.

c51e4cf1-6f4f-484b-ae05-b7318acb5ff4-0
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.660
Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, that's all.

255cb030-2c3e-4551-8f90-72ce6382a0fc-0
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.000
We can continue next and then you can get
the URL from there.

6e89c400-1ac2-487d-a63d-a67997b9ce54-0
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:56.450
Yeah, Authority, there's a sorry,
could you go back Sindhu?

6209b980-e206-46a8-902a-7b005e1a8fd7-0
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.890
Yep, Yep.

dbe4425b-7a9e-49dd-996e-57368f2a66c4-0
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.170
So in the URL scroll to the right, please.

e5a38e79-26a6-4c5b-aeb0-6817dba69ec6-0
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.130
Yeah.

17625d9c-a4a3-4dd1-a604-e1edd6ba1315-0
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.970
So there's dev, right?

33ac83cb-dd7e-4242-b55f-323717047e75-0
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.200
So that dev need to be replaced with dev
int like this, right?

fc6f4c0c-4ff3-4d5b-8fec-196d495f6332-0
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.200
Yeah, like that.

b9bca28a-12f6-48f6-83e7-5b1ebccbf90a-0
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.480
OK, so you can copy the same URL.

ce5c9bb4-9203-4a99-8438-77f39c5c947e-0
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.360
It's the same URL for the last one valid
issue.

34cc1646-c0a4-4e2d-bbb4-e58a948d80bb-0
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.760
It's the last.

fc5491f3-cb67-4bc8-9bb6-d5c4f6fda504-0
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.280
OK, yeah, Yep, client ID.

e9165b17-7d2a-44d8-b1d5-23ca84711bb0-0
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.440
So this is the problem, right?

8f9bf922-e6bc-466d-9133-fb3f9dee877b-0
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.256
So so yeah,
so so the problem I think we need to get

8f9bf922-e6bc-466d-9133-fb3f9dee877b-1
00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:32.840
instead of doing this.

fa782962-74b1-4c01-b7e2-82ff2e3d0d18-0
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.400
So you can see redirect URL right in the
middle.

9f1c3289-b071-47b6-a04f-d41c92bc4ae9-0
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.240
OK yeah.

b263c596-455f-4128-a555-80f358e51d19-0
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.680
So that has_2, Yeah.

15c46ad1-e730-4634-b423-182ccea8940b-0
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.620
So what that means is portal things you
are configuring the second B to C

15c46ad1-e730-4634-b423-182ccea8940b-1
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.680
provider, not the first B to C provider.

b37970f2-348e-4ec0-a51b-35783af9cd35-0
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.805
So it thinks there's already 1B to C
provider because of that inactive

b37970f2-348e-4ec0-a51b-35783af9cd35-1
00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:55.720
settings, I think.

42a948cb-513f-488c-b2ef-adc221dd400f-0
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.160
Oh, so we have to delete it then?

e3f3ad4f-4505-4e08-b1a9-1d6037e5d44f-0
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.160
Yeah,
I think we need to get rid of it somehow

e3f3ad4f-4505-4e08-b1a9-1d6037e5d44f-1
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.840
or just rename that URL while
deactivating it.

c56d2411-31e1-4e0e-81df-4a67d49639b6-0
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.880
If you go to the deactivate site settings.

99cd1fcd-3426-4cf4-a55b-7b4322956782-0
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.720
Indu.

f8366812-e85b-4489-bfc0-95c2984c7f81-0
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.163
OK,
so I'm just trying to understand like

f8366812-e85b-4489-bfc0-95c2984c7f81-1
00:07:15.163 --> 00:07:15.920
where we are.

91dc07d5-a091-4785-b007-fe2447b24d59-0
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.699
I think where it's picking up rather is
that, Yeah, the middle part, right,

91dc07d5-a091-4785-b007-fe2447b24d59-1
00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:22.840
the AADP to C1?

31fa1319-ed9d-45ec-b922-3a6bc27cf70a-0
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.960
Yeah.

42e7de9d-657c-4f7f-80f0-56e82f45f962-0
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.901
So I think that whole setting need to be
if you're renaming it, yeah,

42e7de9d-657c-4f7f-80f0-56e82f45f962-1
00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:30.160
just rename to something random.

a591b18c-a2b7-49b5-bab2-b0bb1a42f38a-0
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.648
Yes_1 put_old or remove the one to old or
something or I'll just Remove this part

a591b18c-a2b7-49b5-bab2-b0bb1a42f38a-1
00:07:35.648 --> 00:07:36.720
alone will that.

1849514e-327d-4eff-87e4-a81e585ffeff-0
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.120
Work yeah I?

c25cf71b-a145-4c56-b97c-62447da73bb1-0
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.267
I,
THINK THAT'S the part it's picking up

c25cf71b-a145-4c56-b97c-62447da73bb1-1
00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:44.600
yeah OK Because YEAH,
open ID connect NO this.

97e2a837-9103-4721-a056-57942f3df5de-0

think DHANUKA if.

a6f8dc4b-9a4c-469a-b309-d8eaf2164b4a-0
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.618
You,

a6f8dc4b-9a4c-469a-b309-d8eaf2164b4a-1

You go to the back screen of this able to
go this one.

bf612045-107a-41d3-84ce-ee1233a3dd95-0
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.139

click it,
click the configure and here you can see

bf612045-107a-41d3-84ce-ee1233a3dd95-2
00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:15.108
Azure ADB to C,
it's open ID connect and the provider

bf612045-107a-41d3-84ce-ee1233a3dd95-3
00:08:15.108 --> 00:08:15.440
name.

3305f9d4-0ea5-4768-9124-efbea130b3bf-0
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.560
We are putting it right.

a77189db-1750-4faf-927f-485a94cf5b97-0
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.320
Yeah, but it's taking two there.

20464dbf-03c8-4656-85b8-d6d82ff37680-0
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.360
Yes, OK.

e210ce04-4f9a-44b3-94b2-817db00ce79d-0
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.796
It's taking two because it thinks there's
already one configure because of that

e210ce04-4f9a-44b3-94b2-817db00ce79d-1
00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:26.200
setting.

9d9eb794-ef5b-4bb5-9ad7-5377d3c1d1c8-0
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.640
Got it.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.440
So I think it's even inactive.

f9d7bd18-19fc-4240-837d-d01c2bd70b7d-0
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.120
It sort of picks it up as, yeah,
still picks it up.

38b390cd-392b-4683-b3a4-ed37ac630742-0
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.680
OK, we'll remove that one.

6c7469f6-0c24-406f-b30c-51b0eab1bf22-0
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.120
And yeah, probably.

6af9c293-bb2f-4172-9138-99027d593f09-0
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.480
What if you delete it?

dfc4a33d-b0cf-4594-966f-9ac896757a71-0
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.800
Just delete it.

8fb1f333-6c6b-4163-9c2f-95deb96c8f8f-0
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.840
Yeah, OK.

286c7be4-6ffc-4d5d-976b-aa2ca75d4825-0
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.160
I don't want to tell it inside.

1b03c72b-240b-4533-b4b0-c1be55136fb8-0
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.520
I think delete it.

a27c0a0b-942d-4642-98b1-ab78fec3e155-0
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.760
Don't delete it from here.

b809c8d9-c5fe-40c1-bc90-43285fbb4fcf-0
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.841
Just go into it, into the setting,
delete the value,

b809c8d9-c5fe-40c1-bc90-43285fbb4fcf-1
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:52.200
clear the value properly.

e6cff094-f8d5-4b54-ad5e-45526fb23919-0
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.960
No value won't help.

a7e3d25b-83da-422c-ba4e-aad09d3e7c01-0
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.720
Rather this one setting name is the issue.

4c2d91a6-f8a1-479b-b046-2015db919d0d-0
00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.484
Just take it, take the name,
put something else on random or hold it

4c2d91a6-f8a1-479b-b046-2015db919d0d-1
00:09:01.484 --> 00:09:02.520
and then do it.

4ec4a520-d2b4-4411-86fc-f7035922ed36-0
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.640
Yeah, it's read only now.

5babb511-ad67-4be1-99d3-fec3a30c112f-0

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.160
So I'll just put it like that.

9bba5f41-9008-4861-8fe1-34bb63f76bef-0
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:13.280

OK, that's it.

b4b5b5ec-356b-4e6e-b525-dbee268f1463-0
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.520
Now I'll sync and see the other one.

50058fe2-0875-4fb8-bd3b-8d11c259627c-0
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.960

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.640
Do we need to?

d7d8f799-6cbd-491f-bbcc-14db0000280d-0
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.000

Configure, configure need to see.

9a566e96-86bf-442f-8bb7-6edcbba19fa6-0
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.840
So now you can see it's back to one.

d4ad20f8-5d42-4368-a8fa-3e547f8aca97-0

1e883b25-c1e5-4399-9b28-e2e55fe82721-0
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:35.190
I think here contact mapping with email
need to be turned off.

ae2180e0-c4c2-4156-b5b6-97826ee46958-0
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.510
This one.

8ce38d18-9759-4a84-85f6-ba99a0b60ae5-0
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.470

6624c206-43c5-4c82-9450-6fc5d7fcf55b-0
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.360
Yeah, that we don't have any claims.

8ac59b08-7bbc-40a0-b411-c5d1b066f5a6-0
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.200
Yeah, OK, confirm.

07086bbe-06f0-45e3-b11a-58579976f58d-0
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.000
That's it.

5783b104-bc87-48dd-b98c-774e722b8767-0
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:49.840

510a08c5-22e3-4f30-b9b1-ea94ac1d74ef-0
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.120
That's it.

ed10c08b-8531-4147-bc36-64c1b6745a8a-0
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.160
You need another sync.

2790a85e-cc1f-47ea-804d-6b9420815907-0
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.520
Yeah,
I'll sync it and and make it the default.

8ca47628-94fd-4407-8945-c1be78a80d9f-0
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.930
OK,
so that's how we have have it configured

8ca47628-94fd-4407-8945-c1be78a80d9f-1
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.120
set as default.

c19150c9-8c16-45ce-bc9f-61f24bea85ae-0
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.360
Yeah, set as default.

8215a6b6-3099-4fc1-9a65-8c6f2cfb37c8-0
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.230
OK, sync.

8cf204d8-b6a2-4bab-b76e-54e3106cf9f9-0
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:12.750
Let's see.

98c10223-b46d-4499-a09e-57ca5f610de5-0
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.080

4878c6c6-e8a0-4946-9726-977a6ce347f5-0
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.812
So it yeah,
it's B to C as you B to C you can see,

4878c6c6-e8a0-4946-9726-977a6ce347f5-1
00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:51.520
but it should be defaulted, not default.

4da41791-d313-424e-97dc-fbd040a37590-0
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.760
Didn't pick it up.

88cab6a8-02a4-4469-b0bb-66e49f2092c6-0
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.040
It's not defaulting.

2e1eb77e-ca31-4a15-be69-2689dadb08e6-0
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.820
OK, it's defaulted,
but I don't think the IT has synced,

2e1eb77e-ca31-4a15-be69-2689dadb08e6-1
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.560
hasn't been synced.

eacd0ecb-2797-4b68-b261-9a2a5f0456b6-0
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.320
I don't know.

5122dfe2-fe1a-4a9f-8345-b89a86eed844-0
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.320
Let me give it again.

2387faf9-eadf-483b-b132-439315d80fd0-0
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.800
Or should we need to restart the portal?

dedf48d6-6190-4fed-a56b-3eeac7463d7e-0
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.800
I don't think so.

2486f00c-5cd4-4d40-b36f-18098c51f170-0
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.400
OK, let me again.

be7026f7-7566-4b0d-8717-123dc218607f-0
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.050
Let let's see B to C part.

02349070-8225-4f61-af27-279a722be61a-0
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.130
Let's let's figure the default part out.

2cc6d202-e9a2-4c8c-88c6-dad78cb35a69-0
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:33.800
Yeah, Yeah.

22ade4fa-2acc-4b0e-905c-7985f0b00c90-0
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.160
All right.

6616ba9c-1a87-4e49-a6da-b3ebfea22975-0
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.320
It's going to Dev.

80e48e52-101f-449d-ab4c-124dcecd6096-0
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:35.600
Yes.

5247bc09-f283-43f4-9a6f-eca06b433199-0
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.720
Can you So.

4bdf869e-f78b-4282-9b26-89bef97f43af-0
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.160
So Dev, as I explained before,
they're two different policies.

8cab3273-ecb7-4302-8a8b-ae382bb004fd-0
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.120
The policies can be in different version.

bcce35ed-f7fd-46ec-bc7e-e129e2a3b42c-0
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.148
Dev and Devin can have different versions
of policies,

bcce35ed-f7fd-46ec-bc7e-e129e2a3b42c-1
00:12:46.148 --> 00:12:47.800
but the user base is the same.

d60f3303-09f3-42bc-97f8-24afe024174e-0
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.320
So if you have a Dev account,
you should be able to login in Dev.

548c7def-04fa-475b-97e4-eb53390c8833-0
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.160
The same account, same account.

3ecddf83-7034-4a40-b820-d183c939551b-0
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.400
OK, let me try that.

996622e7-e336-4659-8987-2a1b6bbe48ec-0
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.130
Yeah, it's going, Yeah.

5ba147ac-297a-4c08-8ced-78b7d0f0e2a1-0
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.160
Face version has been disabled.

4be7396b-20d9-4f40-92ec-f673c2c490de-0
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.640
There's some settings still in there.

fbe1fdf7-e817-4637-a486-1c2ecaf9ec09-0
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.280
Because it is.

e6a5e633-3078-4a92-a74c-9b50e5bc1076-0
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.320
It was having that redirect URL as sign
in.

f239a1d6-23e9-4367-b464-889dbe9a47cb-0
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.960
It's coming back to here.

ba86cfbb-fb55-4909-aabb-3679e26803b8-0
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.320
Is it?

d78b08cb-e5e7-4eb2-8ac1-b6ff20830bef-0
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.080
No, I don't think so.

86410303-cf2f-4f42-be96-c04ed08d6907-0
00:13:50.160 --> 00:14:00.920
I think it was a setting in B to not in
portal.

1644e785-45c3-427d-99d8-1917189ccf4d-0
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.760
So it seems like so could you sign in
again?

7cd1785d-4318-4be1-87f8-e1c8c697a659-0
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:11.280
What happens if you sign in again B to C?

ec4830f2-e69d-44f7-af83-631a89c7fc33-0
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.680
No,
it says registration has been disabled.

36b2d102-b00f-4a6d-ac15-a05ebee81831-0

adaf2dc8-ff43-48fa-9061-29b6d9b472aa-0

6dd53bba-50e7-4333-87c2-37eda78551e8-0
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.890

Yeah, yeah,
I know some CRM now there is there should

0251272d-53b4-4a06-a171-0937399fc569-1
00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:21.840
be a web authentication I think.

fc33edf7-6afd-41d5-8426-cc5a90b51221-0
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.098
Yeah,
that's a portal contact this one port

fc33edf7-6afd-41d5-8426-cc5a90b51221-1
00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:25.640
contact.

b8c11d2a-e6b3-49d8-91e2-0409177fa82f-0

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.680
So see here this in dev your account set
up, right.

a5c428dc-0fc0-4127-a388-d0468b36e080-0
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.600
So you have a link to B to C account in
here, right.

911309ef-7f0b-491f-b4ea-0a8dee29ed57-0
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.160
But I think in Devint you don't have that.

d64437db-41ec-45cb-9863-68bce14772d8-0
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.760
So that's why you can't log in.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.240
So it should be a new registration Yeah.

a273dd1f-2e8f-4d03-bb56-d7f9b5baf7d8-0
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.360
And to create account right.

11e50e52-7074-4c3e-9e89-1ef84af8c34e-0
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.827
You you can't the the problem is you
can't reregister because the your B to C

11e50e52-7074-4c3e-9e89-1ef84af8c34e-1
00:19:59.827 --> 00:20:00.400

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.120
So you're just partitioning right.

8ba814f2-297a-4621-8af5-784eb86e2193-0

Devint,
I haven't created any account but I'll

e8ba43d0-4a7a-4982-b283-ac0a50556cc6-1
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:27.571
check it which one is that this is the
thing right So then you need to register

e8ba43d0-4a7a-4982-b283-ac0a50556cc6-2
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:28.000
Yeah.

9d99241c-b914-4c23-ba1a-e8024ec01566-0

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.280
That's that's why.

38688822-4297-4ce0-b4e1-fea0f7723003-0
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.626

38688822-4297-4ce0-b4e1-fea0f7723003-1
00:20:40.626 --> 00:20:45.696
registering into DEVINT because your your
your account is already mapped to the dev

38688822-4297-4ce0-b4e1-fea0f7723003-2
00:20:45.696 --> 00:20:46.240
instance.

61a28689-286c-43b7-a60c-4dff9c066b3e-0

65791972-e2ca-4df9-9886-cbb77c231127-1
00:20:55.579 --> 00:20:56.440

32885444-cefb-4b30-a72d-bc156c59c6bc-1
00:20:59.556 --> 00:21:03.320
why it is keep so because Devin we never
logged in with B to Z.

53b70809-39a7-433a-8066-f63fcd3ba92d-0

2c7bf48d-936a-4b8e-8e5c-b489327a4b75-0
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.840
Yeah, that's the same account,
Portal account.

2109b9a5-5cc9-4607-9faa-721c68d86801-0
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.640
So from Portal it has created.

7c1ce7d6-1e60-4111-be61-1523b9bf2dac-0
00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.960
So portal created that.

6954deaa-d34e-4e75-9da8-75812d32ce9d-0
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.037
So I thought that, that, that,
that in the B to C provider,

6954deaa-d34e-4e75-9da8-75812d32ce9d-1
00:23:06.037 --> 00:23:09.200
we've turned off the email mapping, right?

db79dfe5-67a5-4351-9211-410fbfbe0a4e-0
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.040
Yeah, we did, yeah.

e71bc0de-7153-48b3-b4f1-aaf1e72124f8-0
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.298
So,
so I expected it to not to create contact,

e71bc0de-7153-48b3-b4f1-aaf1e72124f8-1
00:23:17.298 --> 00:23:20.320
contact mapping with email.

7e1c78c9-8397-4553-8a10-c40badac8280-0
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:20.920
Yeah, it is.

64b19156-9a00-48ec-9e7a-97eb214bff89-0
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.120
We we've disabled it.

fddebeb0-98b8-4ce1-9a12-6a57d0552f15-0
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.896
So I thought,
I thought that's the whole reason why it

fddebeb0-98b8-4ce1-9a12-6a57d0552f15-1
00:23:27.896 --> 00:23:29.240
was erroring, right.

35875a7c-eca1-40a8-aa65-6dbaf508b264-0
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.520
So it won't find the contact and the link
between the contact and the BTC account.

9b4e8f92-5364-4604-93ef-b98caf1d3b80-0
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.376
So when I signed in right initially did
it create that time registration failed,

9b4e8f92-5364-4604-93ef-b98caf1d3b80-1
00:23:41.376 --> 00:23:43.160
It was saying right, yes.

0b9833c4-6ed4-4b41-b49f-f720d59efe25-0
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.501
So that's that's because it can't find
the contact,

0b9833c4-6ed4-4b41-b49f-f720d59efe25-1
00:23:47.501 --> 00:23:51.560
can't find the find your find you find
your contact.

86e63d98-8337-4000-a162-a3ab7021a0c3-0
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.575
So,
so it is saying registration is disabled,

86e63d98-8337-4000-a162-a3ab7021a0c3-1
00:23:58.575 --> 00:24:01.120
therefore you can't log in.

05a60a62-004b-4f3c-a25d-7b6db62c0849-0
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:02.520
OK.

f994dea3-049c-4149-bad4-071331f97e99-0
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.400
In the code behind what we're seeing is
the contact has been created, right?

7749b72c-abcb-438c-88c9-c84ffce3794e-0
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:07.920
Yeah.

ec9b416a-9048-4785-9b4f-726b26193673-0
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.120
So you didn't,
you said you didn't even have have.

56d2a979-df83-4b99-9158-2c58ffa3aa97-0
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.920
So when the contact was created today,
see.

0c2bd531-f840-410f-a946-3f7ac9d0742d-0
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.680
No, no, that's the,
that's the external identity, right.

5f3e5239-758b-4ef7-86a4-80dd9fee3174-0
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.200
So when was the contact?

459c1bff-4a7d-4a67-b8d3-2c4b038bf6e7-0
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:25.040
That is also today because I have never
used portal sign in here in the event.

9c3e8741-427e-4e0a-8f28-eac9959ccb44-0
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.320
That's interesting.

8a06a84d-00b8-4f61-882d-36c0e9f8bb24-0
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.600
So you should be able to login now.

42c3da74-c38b-419d-8874-8e0f025dd462-0
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.560
Now could could you try again?

fb4b2886-d7a9-40a4-aee3-ef5dce9b0b07-0
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.560
Could you try login?

b69fa3af-fa3d-4bb7-b834-745e4831bdef-0
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.280
Yeah.

09edad38-120b-4dee-ae13-c3e5287b9c72-0
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:44.080
OK, wait to see No sign.

01ec80ed-7316-4935-a8bb-d5353836475b-0
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:44.400
And Rick.

aff807e0-807e-4ac1-9dbd-1827c3eebb43-0
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.800
OK, it's going oh, it went in.

4dd11708-27c7-4869-9b6a-abf05eb327f1-0
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.280
Probably it's taking some time.

6d56d4ce-e239-43df-9307-a97b3031aa91-0
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.520
Yeah.

ce316057-9109-439c-aec7-09d46ed7b52c-0
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.680
I think that's weird.

f2532cae-9f51-4b93-96f9-fbe028908073-0
00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.000
That's something you guys probably need
to investigate it.

1bf6c520-9bd6-4ee7-8598-602f02115ffe-0
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.560
It should not it should not create it
should not create a contact.

ce6d41c5-0f55-416d-ad49-f790da0a876e-0
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:13.219
It should how the because this So what
happened was so you, you,

ce6d41c5-0f55-416d-ad49-f790da0a876e-1
00:25:13.219 --> 00:25:20.280
your contact wasn't there,
but you signed in, right?

a0dbcb3b-0f9c-4173-8d62-0d7befd0ddbb-0
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:28.976
And BTC you your account was found in B
to C because it was registered in dev dev

a0dbcb3b-0f9c-4173-8d62-0d7befd0ddbb-1
00:25:28.976 --> 00:25:30.760
environment, right?

88346b1c-76a3-457f-9cd2-cbe4b080dccc-0
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.000
Yep.

78185ce3-0573-4eda-9db8-9d0c537e2efb-0
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.640
So it picked up.

1734da50-618e-488f-b083-53cd4934e21b-0
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:41.891
So it was it redirected you to the portal
with your access token and when it's

1734da50-618e-488f-b083-53cd4934e21b-1
00:25:41.891 --> 00:25:47.760
stored access token,
it couldn't find the contact.

f0346640-18dc-4131-bd00-71581ad4a20e-0
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.040
That's why it was throwing that error
initially.

2e23fca2-1a94-4cc2-895e-f32aa2d16934-0
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.520
Yeah,
that's why it was throwing the error.

ad828508-43a2-47fe-965e-d07e20ea0307-0
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:54.640
Yeah.

a42a1adb-18ad-4758-b7ca-fe4137b995ce-0
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.983
I thought it should throw and stop right
there,

a42a1adb-18ad-4758-b7ca-fe4137b995ce-1
00:25:57.983 --> 00:26:03.625
but it has to for some reason it yeah,
it didn't stop and it went and create the

a42a1adb-18ad-4758-b7ca-fe4137b995ce-2
00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:06.760
contact with all everything but B to C
sent.

2df8e923-d9b3-457f-89b8-206ee1eb4ef0-0
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:12.000
So when when you are registering a new
contact, right, B to C will not create it.

c509ed17-93e4-4976-b47a-56f439216eb5-0
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.440
It just cheques for the contact.

4ef5a053-58d6-4fd1-bf12-9849a12ad3a1-0
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.640
If it is yeah, there, it'll allow it.

3ec10355-e30b-4dee-925d-40c94ba6babc-0
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.112
OK, Yeah, yeah, I, I don't know,
maybe this is a different,

3ec10355-e30b-4dee-925d-40c94ba6babc-1
00:26:21.112 --> 00:26:24.880
maybe DEVINT has a different setting or
something.

99f0d8eb-79c6-4e14-8790-c6223d511716-0
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.880
We've definitely tested this scenario in
dev environment.

92951bc2-5411-4304-bc7d-469e3a02bd0c-0
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:36.720
Dev environment wasn't wasn't creating
because we enabled it registration true.

e01f22c9-ff9d-4e10-ab13-e530471eb3ed-0
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.840
Did that create that time?

eac47916-f1e6-4ebd-86cd-b05a57d9fa79-0
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:45.747
Then maybe can we try to delete the
contact and then try again or or maybe

eac47916-f1e6-4ebd-86cd-b05a57d9fa79-1
00:26:45.747 --> 00:26:52.840
rather you don't have a do you have a
contact in in Devin or maybe think so.

4b6050d6-3426-4549-9a4f-811ac49f9de9-0
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.160
I have you you you think so maybe I can
try.

1b56107b-5470-46a6-aecd-043f370b35f0-0
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.000
Yeah, maybe.

45807890-11ca-4e32-8089-f09d5c0314e4-0
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.480
Let me try.

2685bf4f-5534-4fc5-b293-db099d2a1382-0
00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.732
Well,
first we'll check whether your contact is

2685bf4f-5534-4fc5-b293-db099d2a1382-1
00:27:00.732 --> 00:27:01.600
there or not in Devin.

e346e434-7b63-497e-98bc-5c8ed1ad6ea5-0
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.360
Yeah, just check with them here.

6136de1e-cfd2-4751-87a3-b647b587cf76-0
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.480
I I don't think I'm here.

868ea5bd-6f81-4110-a5a8-81317f578fa3-0
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.760
Vinu, call it your ID.

1575bcb4-f850-4da0-b8c7-0df454d8bdf0-0
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.040
No, not on my.

a0ab847e-7e94-4320-b9a7-27f7d333fc21-0
00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:10.920
Yeah.

815a8ea2-4ad8-4257-aa3b-83748a7bbcf5-0
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.680
Asqua, right?

b4872671-4bf8-43d0-9a66-441e171fcb97-0
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.600
Yeah, it is not there.

4da48544-f00d-43c6-8015-46de5254b988-0
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.080
So let me try as my Asqua.

f7641a94-4a5c-4467-bfe0-50b4682323e8-0
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:14.200
Yeah.

31a7c534-ca19-4a40-8aa3-9d9b2dec1bc7-0
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:14.800
OK.

e7e206a7-bb9b-4249-b517-b14683b9b2b3-0
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.000
All right, before we go there,
so I'll show you something.

8d97df18-113a-42d6-92a4-04585bd5e126-0
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.960
Let's so I've created this for for Devin
testing.

d020d4d4-677d-4e1f-b153-7b072ae68637-0
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.120
I've created this Inuka test one contact.

3d7c1257-25a3-4134-967b-0410a388bbee-0
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.400
Yeah, for sign up testing, right.

b91860fc-6314-494f-9582-05bb9ee9f4a9-0
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.960
So, so I'll show you something.

2dcda05c-e805-428f-9118-c21da798ad29-0
00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:40.000
So if you go to the ARN table,
so there should be ARN in there.

01778106-d911-46f6-8ed3-1b8c74208d1e-0
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.240
Let me go to the QA app qualification.

33707b3f-feec-4c9d-b66a-bd8da6b95553-0
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:54.840
Yep, Yeah, I've created ARN as well,
so we can try signing up with this.

401eb9f8-faa9-4311-be61-4191858b5240-0
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.480
Yep, sign up will not work.

6eb56a95-d63b-4e08-80d0-81f7f107eb51-0
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.320
I'll show what what will happen, Right,
OK, to sign up because sign up.

a2653cc9-ccfd-4a6c-9cbb-db0a78452744-0
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.920
So we still haven't completed the
connectivity network in part.

857f5a27-15eb-4da4-b3bb-f184b4e7aa85-0
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:17.080
So B to C still can't connect to the API
for Devint you mean?

ab09c680-c470-4c7d-b11a-a9cdecdbd585-0
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.240
Yeah, Devint.

46b9a3c8-46f1-429d-b1ad-4cd0e44f00d9-0
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.600
So if I'm logging in with that email,
if you sign up with that.

f2f28ff6-3ca3-4085-ac73-b4fde11f32c1-0
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.960
OK, let me you can copy that ARN sign out.

6a51d6da-27fa-45cc-9b8e-1c64e58d2d62-0
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.320
Yeah, ARN.

4043aeaa-6bb6-42de-b088-6867c0859cc5-0
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:43.640
OK, OK, so if I click on sign in or yeah,
sign in, sign in.

a29c6450-9bf1-4fac-a5d6-1d197b5f9f66-0

And then if you have a secondary email
address, whatever this one.

0e386b92-f9bf-498a-9b4e-3326b81a7f79-0
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.280

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:16.832
So you can use secondary email address if
you have a secondary email address like

f65b6f5d-9f88-4769-820d-7d6aec3e84da-1
00:29:16.832 --> 00:29:17.680

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.110
It won't check the email.

c984ad0f-10b1-413a-9ed6-f24aaeac413b-0
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.030
Is it it just sends the code.

864760cc-ef96-4bae-bd88-b1cf5ee209f5-0
00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.510

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:45.590
Right.

45aded36-18e5-497f-b713-9b0f025d98c8-0
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.040
OK and you can set the password and you
can put the air in.

8cdd898e-09a8-467c-bd1d-86c40424f853-0
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:16.800

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:25.110
OK, 2000, sign up.

51034c63-b963-4946-9763-b3eed43b10d9-0
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.880
Failed to resolve.

0a7b31be-e1a5-46c5-9dab-11e89cfc10a1-0
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.560
That's the API error fail.

eefe75a9-ff25-4f3a-b5d6-efa52f3a8019-0
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.600
Yeah, so, so, so failed to resolve.

f006197b-ce4c-4f02-95a5-a35e8d819984-0
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:44.224
So it it can't you you see there's devint
dot API so that DNS is not set it up yet,

f006197b-ce4c-4f02-95a5-a35e8d819984-1
00:30:44.224 --> 00:30:45.880
but the API is there.

07a952fe-8958-47fa-a8d1-0b3697e52d56-0
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.080
It's all all functional.

4294838b-cfdd-45de-b073-40c5614dbd92-0
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:56.620
But once hopefully we get the DNS
networking stuff configured tomorrow,

4294838b-cfdd-45de-b073-40c5614dbd92-1
00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:03.640
tomorrow is get the guys supposed to do
it, then the sign up will work.

2a8b097c-1982-4026-86cf-70a8fbe54edf-0
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.920
You can come back and test the Devin sign
up here.

5d24e6a3-ea9d-4ad9-ae8a-15fbb83fafb4-0
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.500
OK,
so I will let you guys know when it's

5d24e6a3-ea9d-4ad9-ae8a-15fbb83fafb4-1
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:11.960
done.

264b035e-9916-47b9-9505-7f99d4fd748a-0
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.840
So then Devin should be fully good.

7c83aeb7-30d3-40dc-b05f-6bcdba42af1b-0
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.240
OK, so let's test that.

6bed394d-8d30-4a56-9ce3-1e8c3584a219-0
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.640
I'll share my screen.

959fec32-6518-47a4-a7b4-79ee3ccb88db-0
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.320
Yep.

07e191e4-3812-4b19-8093-d4cfdb96b635-0
00:31:37.600 --> 00:32:00.250
So go to the event,
still it's not defaulting.

721ff2c2-3b01-412e-b760-d814c7d815b5-0
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.770
I don't know why should be defaulted.

38241e6a-ebe7-469e-854e-83d82e3ce97a-0
00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.490
Yeah, sign up.

40a06e25-5243-4157-974a-d4a8264a0953-0
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.720
It's my email address.

bfb1e329-d8a0-4c73-a3d2-864038994427-0
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:31.970
But this is sign up, right, Anuka,
we wanted to sign in and see here.

1c420295-c4a6-4ed6-abf5-90de41664473-0
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.050
You want to see sign in?

22b29e14-4ec7-45a1-9ad0-9d05c8a456c0-0
00:32:33.210 --> 00:33:00.880
Yeah, doing password somewhere.

07318312-ba1f-4ffc-88e0-e2047a9d2fad-0
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.280
It should stop you there itself, right?

2b14a9de-3fc4-4789-a3ea-f3b4da15f3e4-0
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.080
Or no, it's after.

b2c62789-7e9f-4119-b41b-e64068882b77-0
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.440
So we're still in B to C, right?

b9ea9ff3-3946-4d75-8836-a33e5c18eade-0
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.840
So the issue is in portal B to C is like,
yeah, I found, found you.

90d0c4c5-d262-4ebe-9118-b5828c8fd02b-0
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:50.790
I'm going to log you in,
see what happens to me.

aa7b204d-5822-4367-a41b-19379045aa5d-0
00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:54.800
Yeah.

59509252-63fe-416b-972a-a2045655d545-0
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:55.560
OK.

91a1c653-aee3-470d-888f-dc9edea75309-0
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.960
Let me check if it has created your
account.

628ddbb0-1d1d-46c9-95d7-a5df4b678b6a-0
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.420
No, it hasn't created with a log.

b8af6bf8-3907-4f2f-8b3f-5ef3b3572588-0
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.740
So that's what I was expecting.

6628fcae-e4d4-4b1e-abd9-6c98625fa98e-0
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.540
So it shouldn't, it shouldn't create,
it shouldn't create me in there.

b8f101db-d0ce-4d2a-acfd-6c16afe85432-0
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.980
Maybe we enabled that site setting for
once and then tried it.

0850096b-e438-4a62-8015-873b03086fda-0
00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:28.040
Probably that's why, yeah, so I think so.

71c100e7-b1d0-400c-bbc4-a8c794094100-0
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.080
So now I think this is important for for
you guys to know, right.

cc89a722-c913-4306-95ed-339adeb7e34c-0
00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:39.205
So if you log in into a account that
already been registered with dev,

cc89a722-c913-4306-95ed-339adeb7e34c-1
00:34:39.205 --> 00:34:46.731
then you need to sort of manually
configure it manually create the contact

cc89a722-c913-4306-95ed-339adeb7e34c-2
00:34:46.731 --> 00:34:51.448
you mean in Yes,
I mean or or link to a sorry,

cc89a722-c913-4306-95ed-339adeb7e34c-3
00:34:51.448 --> 00:34:54.760
link to contact already existing.

2100956f-3dff-49e1-b583-f2ba242fbd7c-0
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:18.806
So I think the issue is now,
but it's interesting that how it in the

2100956f-3dff-49e1-b583-f2ba242fbd7c-1
00:35:18.806 --> 00:35:21.510
yeah, I'm still concerned.

341f12bc-c2df-49fa-b588-43c73f69883c-0
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.400
Yours didn't come through.

80846f90-9268-497d-a742-b14191cf4e99-0
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.560
I was just thinking that it might come
through after like couple of seconds.

984befc8-5d9c-48de-bc30-2e34144eacb7-0
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.920
But yeah, still no.

29e67c1e-02ba-4de9-9c5c-4d12223cedc7-0
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.120
Can you check?

9df3295e-50af-4c97-936c-7bb51f308f47-0
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.760
Can you check my account?

1c01b640-ef5d-4997-9492-7dd897d60393-0
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.280
Sindhu?

81a16a73-70c0-465a-ba50-505d4358d798-0
00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.360
My ASCO account?

fb1841c5-1ca0-478a-9e7e-b6d4d969486b-0
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.000
Yeah.

eb61050f-16e8-4ca0-8fb0-278000288973-0
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.160
In Devint only, right?

6dbbbed6-e8c1-4977-9129-27478fcca055-0
00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:40.720
Yeah.

ba3cb5af-ada8-4696-84f2-dbe44c155e0a-0
00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.480
If it is ASCO account, I'm not sure.

3ddbf834-1b90-4290-8728-e2a475013abf-0
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.400
I'll double check it.

d044ff7f-e368-4ace-bf04-4decea963c0b-0
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.680
There are lot of contacts with your ASCO
account in there.

88ac0aec-c07b-413d-b2b3-75680885e31d-0
00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:52.040
Yeah,
or we can delete the contact and contacts.

5cb7d785-76f4-42a7-b54c-95eccc488438-0
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:57.872
OK,
maybe I can try to delete my contact

5cb7d785-76f4-42a7-b54c-95eccc488438-1
00:35:57.872 --> 00:35:58.720
again.

92d53b14-d34e-40f8-85dd-9d07ab6380cb-0
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.840
Yeah, I went, yeah.

8b96f1f2-9bad-42a2-9d5a-11af1fd9648c-0
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.302
So I,
I think the important thing is now it's

8b96f1f2-9bad-42a2-9d5a-11af1fd9648c-1
00:36:03.302 --> 00:36:04.320
not doing it right.

3bc576ba-97db-48ab-8971-666dd0e74754-0
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.866
But yeah, I think for for one instance,
it did it and one instated,

3bc576ba-97db-48ab-8971-666dd0e74754-1
00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:11.080
but we have to do another one too.

d55e5e3f-f59b-4e6f-866b-15532c073f52-0
00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.560
Yeah, it's to to have more,
more instances in.

cf9dfc3f-884a-43fb-bf7a-e94976f415b4-0
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:26.756
So I think what's important here is so
you guys probably need to do this

cf9dfc3f-884a-43fb-bf7a-e94976f415b4-1
00:36:26.756 --> 00:36:28.080
manually, right?

bb0c194b-d56b-4bdd-9a9d-ff69bcdda1c0-0
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:33.560
Login.

c35fbb76-160d-442d-9f94-4872a7548b7a-0
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.680
I hope we can do it Email confirmed.

435cef28-908b-4c62-a4bc-a03589800a4c-0
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:49.960
So it doesn't allow you to I don't I'm
thinking of no, just save the username.

0dccfac1-58da-4ab7-b275-73a318ae3b56-0
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.440
It'll create an external identity, right?

66803b17-16f1-4d05-8d2e-e72f1f7445f0-0
00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.480
When you save this one, save this.

1a900205-04bf-4d34-a90b-2a9f48dd66ea-0
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.680
Let's let's create my one denote Yeah.

cecaf573-34df-4e2b-9d69-d5daaee89c8b-0
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.480
Let's save this right?

5de18a8a-af00-4348-88d3-3beac0f53b58-0
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:34.731
Yep, save and close just now to save OK,
so here,

5de18a8a-af00-4348-88d3-3beac0f53b58-1
00:37:34.731 --> 00:37:46.126
so I need to enable email and so it need
to be like if I go to my dev 1I don't

5de18a8a-af00-4348-88d3-3beac0f53b58-2
00:37:46.126 --> 00:37:57.376
know how you do it Is there so is it I
can see the username field is disabled

5de18a8a-af00-4348-88d3-3beac0f53b58-3
00:37:57.376 --> 00:38:07.040
when you create the external identity in
the the grid below right?

4407ce6f-4a38-4a14-896d-721f04fc85e0-0
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.326
When you yeah,
create it probably will it populate might

4407ce6f-4a38-4a14-896d-721f04fc85e0-1
00:38:11.326 --> 00:38:15.763
be when you do that No,
I think you need to have all those

4407ce6f-4a38-4a14-896d-721f04fc85e0-2
00:38:15.763 --> 00:38:18.320
settings populated for it to work.

a996225b-bd17-4194-8716-d04f9e4de359-0
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.760
So I had issues before.

40bf163b-61ab-43b4-8bf0-0ccef65eb4e7-0
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:30.080
No,
I don't want dev int want dev that's 01.

b7324e4b-e100-43b5-be72-82ba5f53a8fb-0
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.640
What's when Devin?

37ae4d7b-eb07-4615-9a3c-eb212ec25149-0
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.160
No, the site name is Devin, but it is.

0a2aed6e-65d5-4f8a-82e1-e7face978c31-0
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.360
That's how it is named.

4c000015-b670-4b35-b976-c3f22549fb44-0
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.160
Yeah, Yeah, right.

5d694f55-4106-428c-b5d9-da5531a380fc-0
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.400
OK.

f380fb02-067f-4319-b939-537af04b3875-0
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:22.870
Your contact is in there.

f6a9f4ad-70c5-4f62-b8e6-58b2cb7729eb-0
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:57.880
So I think, for example,
can we edit this if you open?

4367865f-ff90-4fe0-b928-ffec0c86d8f8-0
00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.240
Yes, I think so, yeah.

6197e0ca-797c-49c1-8139-36f14ea5e07a-0
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.840
So if I go copy this to yeah.

b8ced0d9-2c29-40dc-a006-e9ee8ba44a63-0
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:45.890
I didn't provider same.

eb4e0d06-f527-4fb5-a425-e03c84f69ca2-0
00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.620
So what other settings should you pop?

1b75fa05-f0ac-40de-a172-697cdceb1200-0
00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:03.220
Do you need to populate that username
there in the local identity?

73a35b5c-5443-45f8-8621-f20a516fd7ec-0
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:03.740
How?

39f316bb-7c11-40d7-9e41-6174d3867f38-0
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.180
Yeah is the problem right?

b749c011-0c54-4138-a99d-32899f8f9320-0
00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.380
So do you need special permissions?

8b94ddd0-4de0-49e4-8098-1554350aef86-0
00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.460
Are you not able to edit that field?

261b3f3c-f58e-47f5-a0ba-1aea4e0cf675-0
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:14.800
Because I am able to UI but maybe you
have different permissions.

6bae3d9d-b155-49c5-a5c5-48eb83738544-0
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.920
Can you can you set the username to be
for me?

f95d7d5d-faa8-4e35-a372-61d5fbf0867e-0
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.480
Same as that one, same as this one.

5d213b6a-dfdc-441a-a8fc-d7104c626b17-0
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.120
OK, let me try that.

db0e34a6-f888-4144-be27-5a31ad57ca52-0
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.240
OK.

98374bd4-c06f-4901-9811-1742f291bbdc-0
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.280
Can you refresh your record now?

87033c73-623c-4d3d-8f9a-d0350c70d4c1-0
00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:02.310
Yeah.

f3ce018e-2937-4fa3-92d3-15a159fd39e1-0
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.550
So it doesn't have a security timestamp.

518c5b99-1f9e-4f54-8543-c665d6b4d931-0
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:05.710
Yeah, I don't know.

5b7a23f5-ad49-45cf-b994-53439831d561-0
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.950
There's a problem that I also don't have
the access to edit it.

a1ff7c89-1bbd-44a9-a923-c0a84e22fa54-0
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.510
Yeah.

53ac4625-1f07-4a0b-ad5b-b95ca911eb4f-0
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:18.087
So let's see whether I can log in now
maybe what does the security's timestamp

53ac4625-1f07-4a0b-ad5b-b95ca911eb4f-1
00:42:18.087 --> 00:42:22.671
value has to be Dinuka,
Do you know like how it is in Dev 01 or

53ac4625-1f07-4a0b-ad5b-b95ca911eb4f-2
00:42:22.671 --> 00:42:27.040
it is like something that B to C
generates unique for every?

befcb9fe-93f4-4006-b90d-1c0bb8d9c1d1-0
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.010
Yeah,
it's just generate a unique wait and put

befcb9fe-93f4-4006-b90d-1c0bb8d9c1d1-1
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:30.200
it.

9982dd4d-ac0d-439d-9dc8-e807841fdc52-0
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.760
It doesn't have any relation to it.

66600854-574f-434e-9313-7e709682e7ff-0
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.520
I can put that as well.

ecf09739-080b-444b-8bd0-496880e81d64-0
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.280
It's the same as in dev 01.

83ff84b0-ea3b-490a-a954-de8a573b9012-0
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:40.080
Is it or let's oh, oh, oh, what happened?

ff49a721-87a8-4ffe-bd05-ef3f9a3af0ab-0
00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.600
Yes, sign in again.

e803ce2c-9b55-44e5-bd6e-f68da81cbe65-0
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.480
And maybe it isn't.

d9e19bd0-07b0-44c7-a8da-758d17e1253e-0
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.840
Can you put some GUID in into that
timestamp?

7be58904-ccb2-42fc-a669-f54b3dedbd86-0
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.160
OK, timestamp.

b3836046-2d0f-425d-92d2-290a7f973adc-0
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.920
Let me get yours from dev 0.

069fadfe-2ad5-41d8-a25e-579e9b7ad836-0
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.320
Yeah.

eb34e2fd-7125-4eb3-9873-a14701906456-0
00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.200
Yeah, that's done.

673b5681-a8f5-4749-9ea5-09eb15338805-0
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.000
OK.

5b037462-051b-4c9a-b169-ace04610ea5a-0
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.960
Yep, start again.

a7a0e56d-cbad-45d1-a76b-21db51da772a-0
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.020
Yeah, that's it.

25429a0d-6ac8-48ff-af40-69390c41c3cb-0
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.340
OK, it's logging in.

4d35c993-b9f4-4105-9fe2-abaf7f40c122-0
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:05.900
Yeah, it's logging in.

cc245f9c-008f-4bb6-a844-591126ead9da-0
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.180
So I think that's what you guys need to
do, right.

0195c704-36a4-4e1f-9bdc-9efdcb1092a1-0
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:13.064
So if you have dev registered account
already, Yep,

0195c704-36a4-4e1f-9bdc-9efdcb1092a1-1
00:44:13.064 --> 00:44:19.190
if you wanted to log in into the dev int,
you can't reregister because your email

0195c704-36a4-4e1f-9bdc-9efdcb1092a1-2
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:20.460
it is only there.

22cd84d9-971c-4ce5-90c4-168a1c2ee197-0
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:26.280
So you need to manually link your account.

34689902-1ac1-41e9-87cb-957c1dd7fe6f-0
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.360
Yeah, OK.

091c06a2-4503-48f0-9f39-4a683f1573c5-0
00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.276
To your contact,
create the contact how we did now and

091c06a2-4503-48f0-9f39-4a683f1573c5-1
00:44:32.276 --> 00:44:33.560
then we can log in.

b7fb5745-d67a-4339-804b-0851a9a2e7d5-0
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.000
Yeah, yes.

dc8be505-c008-44de-998d-fbc6a543b2c9-0
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:35.560
All right.

84e62b7d-eb06-45ff-898a-084eae3975d3-0
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.040
Yeah, Yeah, that's it.

709adcb0-7c21-4b26-847c-8a8ce159d99a-0
00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.120
So Devin should be working now fully.

9173f9ec-dc48-4e87-a49a-4009a61e3a45-0
00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.195
And the only thing that sign up is when
the DNS is ready,

9173f9ec-dc48-4e87-a49a-4009a61e3a45-1
00:44:46.195 --> 00:44:47.720
sign up will start working.

0bc650bb-1c5a-4b86-8c73-73cdb88c01f7-0
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:48.520
OK.

e62b74e3-78a5-463d-b430-59ea5747c69f-0
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.986
And for,
I think the the setting that we renamed

e62b74e3-78a5-463d-b430-59ea5747c69f-1
00:44:52.986 --> 00:44:56.360
need to be put back for this to work.

3786d0f5-674b-4886-91ca-a9ec7326b71f-0
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.752
Which one, Danuka,
That setting that we renamed deactivated

3786d0f5-674b-4886-91ca-a9ec7326b71f-1
00:45:03.752 --> 00:45:04.040
it.

4eb0a301-fe88-4ff1-b686-23bb9a169ebb-0
00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.480
I think this yeah, from dev.

8d93de2f-9db7-45e6-80e3-541860e9f3db-0
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.280
So let's, let's do it.

0f71e672-9c8d-442f-a5e6-0d3cb316b66c-0
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.600
Let's do it now.

c4d0f98d-cd6f-4152-8ff7-a9db9df23114-0
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.960
Which one was it?

9ed99c50-7b54-4493-9912-403cd84ed837-0
00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.680
Something starts with old.

6245b3ec-d563-4b5e-b231-22b6ea7d4e22-0
00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.200
Yeah, I'm renamed as old B2 CI think Yeah,
yeah.

2efcd581-8668-49b5-9bb3-8e390ed88bff-0
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.400
What's the original one?

7858ab3d-ca4e-48ef-b971-9643b237b29a-0
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.800
I'm trying to put the additional
authentication open ID connect.

dc96365b-5cfd-49dd-8e12-4b77e1dd1261-0
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.640
Yeah, that's yeah, OK.

51a0e123-cab1-41ec-b74b-7d1fdc2880cd-0
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:36.760
Yeah.

213400bb-bbba-4d69-8143-dde72f21aa21-0
00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.640
So we need to put it back.

45be9ce0-a005-4675-b021-69f4e444f104-0
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.640
So that one, if we put it back, what does?

b51e0f06-08fc-49bf-9e58-2857c1544dce-0
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.840
No, we didn't put it back.

bc781009-cc51-4f00-85e8-8440858809e7-0
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.240
OK, let me rename it and put it back.

bb0d4276-1e0c-40d1-94ad-74408a6d0a3b-0
00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.800
You have the you copied that value, right?

16d7e7e9-035a-4e74-b4ff-2cb09e0cf635-0
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0e77fae6-123c-4f44-b297-443efdcb3007-0
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.080
You said I did ID, let's put it back.

489d9e6e-2fcd-45bc-985d-1f33eb657c1a-0
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:05.680
OK, they went still.

322ac4dd-687a-4267-bfb3-1008b453ebbe-0
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:13.960
For some reason there's not show the
default is not working, right?

4b530e56-8900-4c3b-8700-862be1b01345-0
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.343
Yeah, I have renamed that,
so still it should work,

4b530e56-8900-4c3b-8700-862be1b01345-1
00:46:18.343 --> 00:46:23.000
right after putting that one,
you need to sync after sync.

45b29e37-44dd-4aa2-be7d-042a3b00fda0-0
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.280
It should, Yeah, yeah, I have sync now.

5b501ff9-5820-424f-bcd0-4a34310f3925-0
00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.080
Let me check.

b44f40b7-42c1-47b6-815c-a0ab6121796b-0
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:38.440
Yep, maybe it's fresh.

98d167b5-2c59-400b-ae7d-c03ba7c3e57f-0
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.840
Yeah, it's working.

f2e6cd95-3a8e-4f90-b875-ca6e766c27d2-0
00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.680
Let's let me log out first.

38b0fa89-0c3f-4f49-beab-95d1440c6e49-0
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.760
Actually login is not a real test.

a7b2e727-d698-43c1-9bb7-ef2ed09c0540-0
00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.300
Yeah, it's going to sign up straight.

fa4f3dd5-60e9-45ac-a92f-3e0f15e6903d-0
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:16.453
And one one thing also to remember is so
you can see when you log in,

fa4f3dd5-60e9-45ac-a92f-3e0f15e6903d-1
00:47:16.453 --> 00:47:20.220
it's going to profile page, right?

0f25ce6d-b85a-470a-b2f7-dd5e26daaa21-0
00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:22.860
Yeah.

5c483f90-e022-41da-bd5d-924135b8c686-0
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.520
But in dev you don't get redirected to
profile page, you get.

4157e6a6-85d1-4d3a-9569-2bf8e89c24dc-0
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:37.800
You get to either the home page or the OR
the dashboard, whichever is.

8e1640c7-87a2-4e29-841e-2a5b14092a0d-0
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.280
Yeah, Yeah.

b3450fe8-5c41-4cc9-a873-1b1bd0aa9bfa-0
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:47.040
So that's because during the registration,
I've set a setting check.

d095bcf9-fb45-469e-be08-0eca2e4907a8-0
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:55.747
Remember there's a setting that I said to
say tell the portal that profile is

d095bcf9-fb45-469e-be08-0eca2e4907a8-1
00:47:55.747 --> 00:47:57.720
already set it up.

aff30bf0-8265-4b25-ab03-676f0b563b5d-0
00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:04.024
So don't redirect it,
redirect me to profile page after signing

aff30bf0-8265-4b25-ab03-676f0b563b5d-1
00:48:04.024 --> 00:48:04.320
in.

f99d987e-9ff7-42e2-9470-ac4bfee595fd-0
00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.840
So that setting is somewhere.

def97b2a-bd6c-4151-bb26-57a93d95e7a0-0
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:13.737
So because so now you,
you created a brand new contract contract,

def97b2a-bd6c-4151-bb26-57a93d95e7a0-1
00:48:13.737 --> 00:48:18.640
but it's not wasn't created through
registration process, right?

e9dbec9d-f3c5-44cd-b3d5-c88fdece1691-0
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.200
It was manually created so that now that
setting is missing.

1988a539-3408-4a8c-b558-87f9199535d3-0
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.080
That's why it's keep going to profile.

c88e5ec6-b8b3-4a0d-b782-d80f785e8fd1-0
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:32.400
So the setting is I think the sign in
configuration, right?

13947a7c-08c3-4491-a55c-0ed85ab55264-0
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.480
Tanuka, the top one,
I think it is taking me to profile.

77726204-9448-4432-869a-7e4c00b6fffd-0
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.257
But if you click on the sign in from
qualification integrity,

77726204-9448-4432-869a-7e4c00b6fffd-1
00:48:40.257 --> 00:48:43.000
it goes straight to the sign in Page,
right?

f860c2d9-ad15-4c9d-9f9a-803d36eeae40-0
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.080
I don't think it's a sign in Page.

c434d27f-767e-421d-91ff-cbb9e86031bc-0
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:54.000
It's I think it's done through a setting
your attribute in your contact.

d5514a56-2365-4ada-982f-7c9ac8b7d07f-0
00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:12.920
OK, date contact, we won't enable that.

84c4dae3-0611-4e50-9521-c0de096a1af6-0
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:16.760
This one here.

39bc359b-c70b-4234-8c38-6b0b596f811d-0
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.000
Profile modified on.

9654ae7f-aadd-4492-a546-7253264c06cb-0
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.400
So when you're doing the registration
through the B to C, Yep.

c1a915a7-c8de-4f66-9fe4-81e17d79056c-0
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:30.480
So I set the profile modified on to the
current data.

cedadbcf-1fca-4811-8a28-c86212d51070-0
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.520
OK, right.

d6129e01-1f92-4f3f-9b33-81685be10303-0
00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:39.097
So if the profile modified on to profile
modified on has a value,

d6129e01-1f92-4f3f-9b33-81685be10303-1
00:49:39.097 --> 00:49:43.200
then portal won't direct you to the
profile.

2aaf6675-f2ae-4516-9a21-e0d5fd9ebb91-0
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.080
So it thinks that you want the updated
profile.

33e634b4-97c5-4b74-8674-29efc90c62cf-0
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.240
Yeah, you don't need to show the profile.

e22f064c-7beb-4b8f-8426-63d742cf76cb-0
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.360
So it'll get to wherever the user need to
go to.

84b17766-8ea3-4f79-adfd-aa9edbbd4dac-0
00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.440
But it's not happening because we created,
we didn't set it.

9a63f33f-3240-4c20-8360-ba5ddb4a7c35-0
00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.520
OK it right, It doesn't have to.

863118ac-af5c-441a-b357-689acbd85a75-0
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.240
But next time you update like for example,
Yeah.

e209f3e4-5589-4c66-ae0e-50880bfd77d9-0
00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:09.600
So now when I log in,
I think I'm still logged in to B201.

c6c58f9f-fa1c-48a0-9017-ff13023c0c57-0
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.920
Hopefully it won't ask me to log in.

ede38aab-ebb7-4132-8e0b-f857f75607ae-0
00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:23.640
Yeah.

311fc721-17da-4e57-9853-818579440a94-0
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.200
So if I login, it'll go,
it'll take me to profile.

5b2e7025-09ae-4229-8607-d321ac5e0348-0
00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:30.520
But if I update the profile,
it won't take me to profile again.

6553d5c4-5f0e-4191-8373-a03dbeb6a3d2-0
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:37.569
It'll just populate that profile updated
on and then next time won't won't be

6553d5c4-5f0e-4191-8373-a03dbeb6a3d2-1
00:50:37.569 --> 00:50:38.440
redirected.

a58c0e45-0c29-4a7e-a25f-129aaf573e88-0
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:39.720
OK.

c2a354a5-aec5-4ea2-a099-704ebceab11c-0
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:43.640
Yeah.

41898278-85fe-45f1-864e-2844eb44dc44-0
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.560
So I think that's about it.

f94da9f3-dce1-403c-9490-09ff52637f1d-0
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.640
Regarding the event,
the event should be good.

62a138ed-547e-46e4-9829-8df6e021493d-0
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.720
I think that's all the B2C stuff I wanted
to show.

14477b55-9f53-43cd-8060-a2cf7436943f-0
00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:03.040
So I've got,
I've got RMA fully functional.

af344f84-564a-44f6-8526-9bb273e874c5-0
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:13.520
Maybe after stand up I'll show this to
the team everyone.

bd68bae8-1ecd-431c-bf2d-8a2dce4c9a80-0
00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:14.320
Yep.

c1213508-b770-4961-a486-5ba64367d259-0
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.160
So, so now you have the ARN.

92432665-2549-4aa7-94ec-d4729aea3cf7-0
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:26.600
So ARN can be either student ARN, Yep,
or a contact ARN.

4dae26f8-fd8b-4acc-bbef-66095134dd6c-0
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.720
So that's how I, we've done it.

dea3fffd-ce23-4e7a-8203-362d816cfda2-0
00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:28.840
Yep.

69d9748c-faa9-4dff-be19-8078b3fc08d4-0
00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:35.701
So depending on if they enter student ARN
or a contact ARN,

69d9748c-faa9-4dff-be19-8078b3fc08d4-1
00:51:35.701 --> 00:51:40.000
it will be shown the correct sign up form.

bd468395-cde4-4a60-9476-763246bb54e6-0
00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:44.600
And after sign up, it's just normal,
right?

a7b38f2a-7465-4240-898f-25ce7423f660-0
00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.360
Just redirect to the homepage for now.

2d76ed9c-e3e6-49a0-a91a-561c0ca83763-0
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:47.480
Yep.

f6688185-79fa-4eaf-ae4f-07274b134b67-0
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.000
OK, that'll redirect you to the home page.

d6e9b495-4a40-45fb-bf4c-5f24fe4f6a5f-0
00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:56.903
If you want to change that page in future,
please let us know where to configure it

d6e9b495-4a40-45fb-bf4c-5f24fe4f6a5f-1
00:51:56.903 --> 00:52:00.841
probably after our No,
that that's something for you guys to

d6e9b495-4a40-45fb-bf4c-5f24fe4f6a5f-2
00:52:00.841 --> 00:52:02.520
show in the future, right?

15cd5b47-e541-4818-9e27-8905934e89dd-0
00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.120
Yeah.

8495821b-19d4-4978-a5b1-60863c30895b-0
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:10.128
Because so in the portal,
so when you enter the sign up,

8495821b-19d4-4978-a5b1-60863c30895b-1
00:52:10.128 --> 00:52:19.280
when you get redirected to B to C,
you don't know where it need to go, right?

97ab4223-ee46-4993-a7e8-6c221a0abcba-0
00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:24.377
Yeah,
B to C So B to C need a redirect URL to

97ab4223-ee46-4993-a7e8-6c221a0abcba-1
00:52:24.377 --> 00:52:31.480
be provided to B to C to redirect user
after sign up or sign in, right?

2c0a01d0-a6fb-4379-8692-fac38817921b-0
00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:32.280
Yeah.

2191b380-956a-41fa-b9e5-45f46f4f693a-0
00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:38.880
But B to C does not have permissions to
modify the URL given to you, right?

69342765-9816-46a1-a70e-5589074a7360-0
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.400
B to CB to C will simply redirect the.

d58d7f64-409c-47b6-8d39-3f1b32b328cb-0
00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:47.320
If you provide a default URL,
it'll redirect to default URL right?

3c9936be-d4a1-4320-bfd1-93488aad1923-0
00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:53.680
Even though B to C will know what the
role is right during the sun yeah.

91c5de69-2810-4046-a5c9-a06f646236f5-0
00:52:54.520 --> 00:53:00.760
So when you land on the default page,
then you need to have logic in there to

91c5de69-2810-4046-a5c9-a06f646236f5-1
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:07.480
redirect to redirect you need to pull the
contact and do what Jamie said right them

91c5de69-2810-4046-a5c9-a06f646236f5-2
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:12.760
said you will have in the profile you
will have like preferences.

dc5b3f70-607d-43f0-814e-691ccf452990-0
00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:19.563
So depending on the preferences,
you'll get landed on to the preferred

dc5b3f70-607d-43f0-814e-691ccf452990-1
00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:20.480
landing page.

21cd4d39-047a-4293-b5cd-7577d43d7217-0
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:21.920
OK, got it.

00bc7038-3e6a-46ed-8e10-9a3e9227a873-0
00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:22.840
Yeah, yeah.

f18eced2-57e0-46c3-a5e8-24b013b81882-0
00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:30.524
So that that logic purely need to be in
portal or B to C only can redirect you to

f18eced2-57e0-46c3-a5e8-24b013b81882-1
00:53:30.524 --> 00:53:32.680
a default landing page.

18afb99a-639b-4c69-899b-20b82dc24cb6-0
00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:38.200
OK, OK,
So there's a new policy called as per

18afb99a-639b-4c69-899b-20b82dc24cb6-1
00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.120
sign in sign up.

10cf03e4-c147-4a3a-b802-859d18ed52e0-0
00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:47.408
So that's so,
so you can see there's there's if you go

10cf03e4-c147-4a3a-b802-859d18ed52e0-1
00:53:47.408 --> 00:53:47.840
dev.

4cad2eb6-57c4-4549-b996-a6e3dc0a07d8-0
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.480
So there's,
this is the one that we're using, right?

64319118-0ef2-4540-b9ad-b6303ad1a3ad-0
00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.480
This is the one we configured the other
day.

61a7ff58-fb14-482c-8c19-a33895f5ddbf-0
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.440
I, I sign in, sign up.

64d221bd-3a3a-4cd8-bfdb-0fd77fac67d5-0
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:07.358
And now there's As for sign in, sign up,
dev As for sign in, sign up,

64d221bd-3a3a-4cd8-bfdb-0fd77fac67d5-1
00:54:07.358 --> 00:54:09.200
which is a unified, right?

cd3d9103-54ac-4d06-a3af-1e8311f3e689-0
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.520
OK, so unified version of it.

23816da2-bcdb-4337-8f3e-a2a441e2da15-0
00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:18.360
So both RMA and QY can sign up by
entering there.

3e5493a4-1e23-4955-83da-d00bc05dfa0d-0
00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:19.320
Yeah.

8bf79a4d-959c-4122-ba73-0d6bf11a7cce-0
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.009
So if we are going to deploy this policy
and test,

8bf79a4d-959c-4122-ba73-0d6bf11a7cce-1
00:54:25.009 --> 00:54:29.160
how do we do it in probably tomorrow
after you?

6925acc9-8b8e-4628-9f7e-0d7698e77fca-0
00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.280
Oh, it's all there.

c2c419dd-8d08-4acc-ae12-0d068b8eb127-0
00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.440
It's already deployed to B to C, Yes,
right.

549495b6-b1f5-4bf5-bc5b-f67776585cf5-0
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.880
The policy is there so you can run it.

e54bf315-ca4f-4f1f-aac0-fcf1756477cc-0
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.200
So that's why how I showed you before,
right, So you can run the policy.

92d26d6a-aab8-4c61-b2a7-fb5250948a88-0
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:45.067
So what we need to do is go to dev
environment and reconfigure the B to C

92d26d6a-aab8-4c61-b2a7-fb5250948a88-1
00:54:45.067 --> 00:54:49.720
settings, Yes,
to point the policy name to this policy.

796d3712-9047-4000-9d58-f140607dd72a-0
00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:50.880
Exactly.

17c0f999-86a7-4438-abad-408162548d43-0
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.120
Yeah.

a1bedd25-4932-4637-9cea-e8ece2bfd5c9-0
00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.280
And then the portal will redirect to this
new one.

d9d4eb6e-bad1-4750-8864-c60a3e6f5c7d-0
00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.160
OK, so I haven't done that.

373c36de-60e4-4da2-932a-4b35053a7d3f-0
00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.640
I'll show it to the team tomorrow and
then tomorrow.

303a698a-8147-4d64-9ac9-e0775f3dbc8a-0
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:09.977
And if they're happy before I finish up,
we can configure the they have to use

303a698a-8147-4d64-9ac9-e0775f3dbc8a-1
00:55:09.977 --> 00:55:15.000
this new policy instead of the impacted
impact individual one.

dd1aced3-33c4-4c0e-b3b9-a6d20f2617fb-0
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.880
OK, sounds good.

5eabd96a-aeba-4b7a-bd72-19572a32c1cf-0
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.480
That's it.

e4fe7355-85f8-4636-b9fa-23554f5b5308-0
00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.480
I don't think we need any.

0b97118a-8925-4391-8d9c-e8a43e505c61-0
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:22.840
I don't.

7b118405-06b5-446d-bf02-c092b478e958-0
00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:31.520
I don't think we need any B to C handover
sessions anymore tomorrow after the demo.

6ccbb27c-4319-45e4-b01c-266fe5b390bb-0
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.320
Just to give an idea like.
