a3b52d8e-e2bd-4d21-bde7-05558eff2a5a-0
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.840
The POC I've done for Am I sharing?

89762109-eca3-4ef7-b575-36751fe84ece-0
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.840
What am I sharing?

f1a8c2b5-b678-4683-badc-9f308c0716f6-0
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.920
OK,
I'll move on to the screen and drag stuff.

896d453a-2f23-47c2-ba5f-d9638527e5e2-0
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.800
So I've created this policy called
identity proofing.

a92778f1-faec-45d4-b03f-8c38cea5f344-0
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.200
So identity proofing.

b5a38622-ed43-4b89-ae9e-3748aaea5eb3-0
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.800
So let me share the VS Code as well.

275056e2-8c5c-4c3f-b6f9-b06a46bef94b-0
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.960
Yeah, so Azure B to C have the concept of.

4bdca370-b875-4031-b8ae-62a704102ea4-0
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.863
So Azure B to C is external identity
provider,

4bdca370-b875-4031-b8ae-62a704102ea4-1
00:00:49.863 --> 00:00:54.680
external identity provider to at least
the portal, right?

ca64fd24-7f6e-44c4-a566-c0c046fbcc68-0
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.713
So B to C has the concept of you can plug
in other external ID providers to B to C

ca64fd24-7f6e-44c4-a566-c0c046fbcc68-1
00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:10.126
For example, you can plug in Facebook,
you can plug in Google, Microsoft,

ca64fd24-7f6e-44c4-a566-c0c046fbcc68-2
00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:13.679
you can plug in those external providers.

bb5f964b-16e1-4d55-ad0b-160d67968b7b-0
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.924
And then when it's when the users try to
authenticate,

bb5f964b-16e1-4d55-ad0b-160d67968b7b-1
00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:26.720
you can have those options to
authenticate.

699beeea-6620-4eaf-b1d5-952883ab9654-0
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.400
So My ID will be integrated similarly.

af36faec-8be2-4c09-9bef-75b04e4d6117-0
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.360
So you can see there's a technical
provider domain name Google.

7f277cc7-933f-444b-91eb-630882d6b99e-0
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.160
So there will be.

414542d3-2b91-4907-a69e-8e4a9abb253d-0
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.280
So the plan is there will be My ID domain,
they won't be Google.

f8bf4b7a-adaf-41d1-a7c2-9b19753b3b04-0
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.655
So just for simulation,
I've created that and then so you need to

f8bf4b7a-adaf-41d1-a7c2-9b19753b3b04-1
00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:09.680
configure this technical profile to
enable the IDP external identity provider.

5a7b32b2-4913-44bf-9f8d-d0bd8a43ae41-0
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.747
So,
so there is key bit of information that

5a7b32b2-4913-44bf-9f8d-d0bd8a43ae41-1
00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:22.790
we need to fill in the authorization
endpoint, access token endpoint,

5a7b32b2-4913-44bf-9f8d-d0bd8a43ae41-2
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.400
claims endpoint.

0c03a999-4316-4d9b-9672-5f831ad30cb6-0
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.880
So these will be very similar to these
settings for my ID.

88008d5d-1490-4914-9f51-6c5fcf80d298-0
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.280
My ID will have their own settings.

e022c02d-e87b-43a3-b004-03e59b8fb757-0
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:48.880
Actually maybe let me let me check the
Pradeep shared this document with me.

b14187f7-8ea1-4bb6-a76b-4e8d503a3a0f-0
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.880
I'll Pradeep got this document.

2cb2bd0c-c213-4c25-8611-1f81f2c5ae85-0
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.080
Yeah, this one here.

266263b3-b16c-4417-aa6b-1e26ab32c121-0
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.880
So where do you get these information
from Tanuka, all those.

32232a1f-c71b-4256-9607-87b33f2c195b-0
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.160
So for Google today's I'll I'll send you
a link.

284d6b48-dfd0-446d-86dc-ab84578a46eb-0
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.520
So there's yeah, mistakes.

a36fee32-a9ac-4058-acb0-c3175b502371-0
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.680
Today's Microsoft documentation how to
set up Google.

ed7c8c08-a011-4061-b2ca-7d752dc7f6db-0
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.200
Yeah, but there's also.

6d8bd25a-0418-4734-91ee-cac87d7f8f50-0
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.280
So that's just for simulation, right?

2734189a-1ed9-4067-a071-a25a5b597099-0
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.000
But our real thing is My ID.

1c19d471-8fcc-45b6-87b3-e9bacac46fe3-0
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.480
So you can see My ID has documentation.

fec37a02-09de-4c23-9dbd-e5ab95664a92-0
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.920
This is the technical documentation that
Pradeep shared with me.

4b89b778-6909-4542-b6b7-2964e6b19650-0
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.960
To integrate with My ID,
our application need to be on boarded

4b89b778-6909-4542-b6b7-2964e6b19650-1
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.080
onto my My ID.

f91577f4-479d-46e3-9dab-fabd1172be0e-0
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.960
So Pradeep and Jamie has done the
onboarding part,

f91577f4-479d-46e3-9dab-fabd1172be0e-1
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.560
but we haven't got the credentials yet.

c2f1dbc1-ff4f-4945-994f-31599146aa7c-0
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.295
So to integrate,
we need some credentials to talk to my ID,

c2f1dbc1-ff4f-4945-994f-31599146aa7c-1
00:03:57.295 --> 00:03:58.400
the back end.

e96d4343-5773-4888-b6a4-13d5a62ea341-0
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.160
So that bit of information we don't have,
right.

d7010395-8b87-4be8-8004-94658a8cbe85-0
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.447
But as is short, so,
So what I was showing before here is how

d7010395-8b87-4be8-8004-94658a8cbe85-1
00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:10.360
to connect to Google.

ff2d2e6a-e254-4d56-b03b-e1868136b792-0
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.320
So you have a client ID and you have a
secret, right?

4de459da-51c1-4b80-8221-245ab3e81d61-0
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.320
So that's how BTC integrates to Google.

9ddca796-b967-4974-8749-72a113459af7-0
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.234
So similarly,
so they've given in this document here,

9ddca796-b967-4974-8749-72a113459af7-1
00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:37.403
there's a, there should be somewhere here,
there should be that bit of policy XML

9ddca796-b967-4974-8749-72a113459af7-2
00:04:37.403 --> 00:04:46.120
that need to be that you need to
configure to connect to my ID.

b107ad24-158d-4c10-a88f-c61ffca9a03e-0
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.300
This is the registration form.

665abe25-eaf7-4d72-a70e-cd892020c0be-0
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:45.740
This is the XML this the Jason go to set
XML in it.

91515518-6dc6-48b0-8a40-eb0af383a2c4-0
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:56.380
This is what's its generate the request
URL token request.

26814122-8528-47b4-b30f-7404f3695233-0
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:18.567
You saying for sure If you want to get
the using for that API call guide to

26814122-8528-47b4-b30f-7404f3695233-1
00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:22.090
registration I'm sure.

2ca72a3c-a198-4c16-9d89-d8236a0a4385-0
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.930
Maybe it's the other document,
not this one.

fed810b5-9936-46ed-a447-977cfff8d53e-0
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.520
Yeah, now this one is another document.

7bf0470f-7ce2-45d9-ad7a-b180ee057358-0
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.440
No, no, not this.

64671bf7-598b-4a71-ac0d-3e9edffb7f29-0
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.720
So this this dual prove different
patterns of integration.

7ee2cb5e-1951-48cd-a170-6e2be49d0c94-0
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.360
I don't think this has examples in it.

247966df-330a-4f88-9042-8450c9f65f26-0
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.080
Yeah.

e1a623aa-48f6-478c-8ed9-db1d0a3d6c41-0
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:19.601
But it's good to go through these
documents sort of have a mapping of what

e1a623aa-48f6-478c-8ed9-db1d0a3d6c41-1
00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:22.640
P1, what P2 and what P3 is.

d6d9be08-f7a7-4fe5-963c-cc84d5e09824-0
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:33.080
And so it has different describes
different levels of strength.

87a359eb-e2a5-42b2-82ad-b36daf7c0e0f-0
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:42.513
So this is the high confidence,
this is what we want level 2 and this has

87a359eb-e2a5-42b2-82ad-b36daf7c0e0f-1
00:07:42.513 --> 00:07:45.160
different patterns in there.

a80e6f76-6eac-47f4-aec6-dc25ebe7a65a-0
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.718
So, but I can recall,
I've seen that policy XML,

a80e6f76-6eac-47f4-aec6-dc25ebe7a65a-1
00:07:49.718 --> 00:07:53.440
but they they should be able to provide.

87ab3a42-4dd5-432d-be6b-95e3b2ce511c-0
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.200
So whatever you have configured there,
right, Those yeah, information.

0f373010-c855-4b13-a58a-302395bef377-0
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.960
So there was a XML somewhere here.

158c90d9-2b89-479e-9a81-3d4a84d8f0c9-0
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:26.880
Exchange process, No, it's not here.

a1ff28c0-5982-4125-a0ac-4745a31c3f8b-0
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.840
I've seen it somewhere,
maybe on the Internet.

9ef6665c-159b-4577-a449-b4a8fb79bd0d-0
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.241
But anyway,
when you talk to them they they will let

9ef6665c-159b-4577-a449-b4a8fb79bd0d-1
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:37.880
you know.

8a80b15c-c1a6-4fb1-9fdf-e7eb6c4ba716-0
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:44.568
But again,
so here the way it would work is that you

8a80b15c-c1a6-4fb1-9fdf-e7eb6c4ba716-1
00:08:44.568 --> 00:08:52.140
need to pretty much provide this
information configuration,

8a80b15c-c1a6-4fb1-9fdf-e7eb6c4ba716-2
00:08:52.140 --> 00:09:01.480
my ID configuration and then a client ID
and secret and then the sign in.

a8cf1110-67b4-4d63-925d-1cd768c7609e-0
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.280
I don't think we need to sign in because
we won't be signing into it.

13b1d054-69e7-4f05-b01b-91c96f18d4a1-0
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:16.285
We'll be just so for example,
again the starting point is the user

13b1d054-69e7-4f05-b01b-91c96f18d4a1-1
00:09:16.285 --> 00:09:25.594
journey and is so that information then
OK, what we have given here, right,

13b1d054-69e7-4f05-b01b-91c96f18d4a1-2
00:09:25.594 --> 00:09:33.800
the provider name, authorization token,
something like that, Yeah.

e32db2fc-3101-4028-80bc-69f350c98aa8-0
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.440
So that will be provided from Services
Australia.

9e294ef4-86ac-4ab2-b3cd-2df300fa55f5-0
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.600
Which information are we waiting for from
them to enable this like that?

675fadd8-c835-4a5f-9e0e-e51ee0270535-0
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:50.373
That information that I've,
I've shared the technical profile before,

675fadd8-c835-4a5f-9e0e-e51ee0270535-1
00:09:50.373 --> 00:09:51.040
right?

190b416e-afb7-4cba-875b-cbbda84584e8-0
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.000
So this one here.

c1e9422c-8f31-4491-93e6-7b8182d8b7dc-0
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.720
So we need all the information that it
need.

41de7b64-4a9b-4c4a-b352-a0ebe899b67c-0
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.720
Where was it?

771b3c3a-8ecd-41d5-86e1-77ca9fa879fd-0
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.080
Yeah.

8c38e64d-ed35-4d26-a7c7-e5cdb39943b3-0
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.178
So you,
we need to get all this information,

8c38e64d-ed35-4d26-a7c7-e5cdb39943b3-1
00:10:10.178 --> 00:10:11.000
all right.

17a6d0b0-37bd-4fa6-b766-15badb3a86b6-0
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.581
So all these information will be given by
them once they complete the onboarding

17a6d0b0-37bd-4fa6-b766-15badb3a86b6-1
00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:18.240
for they they completed the onboarding,
right?

6e6edcd2-c2f1-4a22-ab0c-12567bb540c6-0
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.840
They should have this information already
available.

da89c7af-49a8-481a-b3fe-e8b8e6c679e6-0
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.440
OK.

31dd1cd5-2512-4508-9032-91f4c1dbf5fc-0
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:28.398
I think what we were struggling is to
find a Service Australia contact to talk

31dd1cd5-2512-4508-9032-91f4c1dbf5fc-1
00:10:28.398 --> 00:10:28.640
to.

77988dd4-99ac-4ebe-a63d-86a04691950d-0
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.320
So we've made some progress.

b3d716c4-f8ad-4934-936c-423c48a79977-0
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.107
Yeah, I think you, you,
you guys need to work with Pradeep to get

b3d716c4-f8ad-4934-936c-423c48a79977-1
00:10:37.107 --> 00:10:38.320
that information.

b5bd7ca1-b958-43f8-adf7-47390faf6040-0
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.480
He will get you this information.

0406ab2b-1867-425c-b86a-1576c4f3b164-0
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.520
But I think the mainly what we're looking
at.

4e22bf4a-7a3a-4711-b8b8-113db38fb70e-0
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.200
So I think we can make up those
information from that PDF.

1c77fec6-c08c-4b6b-be3d-e35599756790-0
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.528
Yeah,
mainly what we after is the client ID and

1c77fec6-c08c-4b6b-be3d-e35599756790-1
00:10:51.528 --> 00:10:52.520
the secret.

9e08a8de-1264-4d26-8f5d-b988b59ebe72-0
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.720
OK, got it.

42d575fb-c23c-4463-bbb8-243e87e30423-0
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.880
Those, those are the 2.

1f9563b9-0354-4eac-8b86-b8f159263bbf-0
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.920
So,
so in in my ID there are two environments.

4c127e78-cf75-464b-89dd-c12bebc9f809-0
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.450
So they have a sort of like a sandbox
environment and they have a production

4c127e78-cf75-464b-89dd-c12bebc9f809-1
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:05.480
environment, right.

155c7cd3-febb-4634-85e1-cc164a1ed8a3-0
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.000
OK.

5e640981-7860-4002-b56a-77cd7baf7dc5-0
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.670
So I think when we talk to them,
we need to ask them because we have

5e640981-7860-4002-b56a-77cd7baf7dc5-1
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.160
multiple non product environments, right?

5e9ef069-f075-4a99-b046-727d6b5720f8-0
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:13.680
Yeah.

374f2092-5624-4408-ae3f-073d86be44a5-0
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.931
So we need to ask them how we can sort of
have multiple environments connected to

374f2092-5624-4408-ae3f-073d86be44a5-1
00:11:19.931 --> 00:11:20.800
the sandbox.

df06fc80-6b3e-4ead-ba1f-d7fe0d1a23e3-0
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.632
OK, yeah,
because we want to test that in low

df06fc80-6b3e-4ead-ba1f-d7fe0d1a23e3-1
00:11:24.632 --> 00:11:26.160
environments, right?

683c92a2-70d6-469d-82cc-aecf00e4f013-0
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.280
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

f62cefa0-1354-4f21-83e7-3169b1b78dbe-0
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.120
Yeah.

a1876be5-859e-4f84-9388-77dfaaa680c4-0
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.200
So that's that's a question OK for them.

ccfd5a58-8617-45a6-9738-6a374f83d224-0
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.640
But so this is very simple.

9daae17a-8cd0-4e91-8eda-6b179a75abfa-0
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:47.040
The the Google is configured so you can
see step one combined.

f3da1190-5620-449b-bc16-dbf13acdb27c-0
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.880
So you have the sign in enabled.

9d789851-dbcf-49c3-9d0a-1d5ce8aa5bd1-0
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.400
So we have the local sign in available
enabled.

020df9b0-6cfb-4dec-b6d4-ca0ac81b4453-0
00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:05.960
So that means so we so for £100 ID check.

5bd714fb-749d-43a8-8029-205d72902066-0
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:13.972
So when we landed on this policy,
so we expect the user to be already

5bd714fb-749d-43a8-8029-205d72902066-1
00:12:13.972 --> 00:12:15.880
logged in, right?

faaa2fe4-29bd-4337-85c1-5b047e0dadf7-0
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:23.278
Because the way the £100 ID check is
going to work is you either sign up or

faaa2fe4-29bd-4337-85c1-5b047e0dadf7-1
00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:27.900
sign in,
you go to the profile and you hit that

faaa2fe4-29bd-4337-85c1-5b047e0dadf7-2
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.960
link right.

cfe52373-9f1d-4fee-85e4-91421630cab0-0
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.120
So, so users already logged in.

a0f866cb-de1d-4458-808f-840b2c784efe-0
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.900
The first step for us to make sure is
users logged in if it is not logged in,

a0f866cb-de1d-4458-808f-840b2c784efe-1
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.600
get them to log in right.

575f8530-1cc7-4d46-985f-3ac00c1a2033-0
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.821
If there's somehow like copy the URL or
something and stuff hitting the profile

575f8530-1cc7-4d46-985f-3ac00c1a2033-1
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:46.560
button, right.

ca76a7e8-eba0-4889-9074-922a97c65701-0
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.520
So if they come from not from the portal,
if they come directly.

27a02a6c-6ec6-4f0d-b147-ba274afac14f-0
00:12:52.520 --> 00:13:05.960
So make sure that it's we've done that
and then then we have a link to Google.

5149eb5e-fed8-4165-b856-6a6a932ef759-0
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:11.120
So so this will be there will be a link
to my ID sort of thing, right.

eafd0b0e-6d55-46b7-95cc-902ba668a3c7-0
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.927
So if I run this policy,
but unfortunately I was having some

eafd0b0e-6d55-46b7-95cc-902ba668a3c7-1
00:13:15.927 --> 00:13:20.566
issues with this policy where I've
created a test Google account,

eafd0b0e-6d55-46b7-95cc-902ba668a3c7-2
00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:23.800
that test Google account,
they've removed it.

dd1a81ef-f294-4464-af37-ecf9fd918503-0
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.240
So all the setup I had was lost.

a946a153-7e4f-4927-bc14-b3fdec9e1aff-0
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.520
But the policies who removed it, Google,
Google has removed it.

3b74d070-ddaa-4169-80a0-c9c1c35485db-0
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.520
Yeah, the account was removed.

db30d189-6729-469e-97a3-5d574b64cee4-0
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.760
I I don't know why, but OK,
It was a test Google account.

f60fbe5e-a634-4a57-b0c2-04f82eb14208-0
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.025
Yep,
I tried to configure it just now with my

f60fbe5e-a634-4a57-b0c2-04f82eb14208-1
00:13:47.025 --> 00:13:50.240
Google account,
but it's still not functional.

4ef9582a-fe87-4026-90b5-3d0d8684327d-0
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.080
But we need to hide this.

7042036a-5042-42d2-adc8-ef8920dfb002-0
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.880
OK, yeah, we, we don't,
we don't need this.

58ceae4d-d854-426f-835b-74ec5ca92fcb-0
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.000
So it's just local login, right?

ec608a06-7eb3-4f82-a40d-632157776da3-0
00:13:59.600 --> 00:13:59.720
Yep.

b1732003-512b-4b5b-961c-368e47284826-0
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.880
So if I use a local login here.

3f5514dc-ee99-41f4-bfc2-6c9489a8c87f-0
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.040
So you have see,
you see there's a link to Google, right?

0c6312ce-19f8-4224-8b92-8fc1322eed34-0
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:41.220
So I think the behaviour for my ID,
there should be a link to my ID and there

0c6312ce-19f8-4224-8b92-8fc1322eed34-1
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.440
should be another link to.

b4fad9b7-2316-4c75-866a-1fb6b8d3ce7b-0
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:49.043
So we could ask the question,
do you have a standard strength digital

b4fad9b7-2316-4c75-866a-1fb6b8d3ce7b-1
00:14:49.043 --> 00:14:49.280
ID?

9909911d-d9ee-4c25-9c36-38736e9528a1-0
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.360
If it is, yes, click on My ID.

094e9cb2-89fb-431e-be00-24d3202f0976-0
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.600
If it is not click on the alternative
service, right?

3f1bc305-b434-4247-b173-1e3e901fb6d7-0
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.280
So when you click on it,
it should take you to Google.

84b290e0-0e27-4ae5-9054-6635e486bb8c-0
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.080
So this what happened, right?

77ab5c57-719d-4525-b6ce-fba2ceb7a7d1-0
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.200
So it's, it's,
it's broken because it's removed.

ac6987df-66b3-46a7-b336-bc988958736d-0
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:15.520
Otherwise this would have taken me me to
Google and asked me to log into Google.

1ae7088d-6df4-4c85-b7c5-fc9e52202526-0
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:23.752
So once I've logged into Google,
it'll ask me for consent because so in

1ae7088d-6df4-4c85-b7c5-fc9e52202526-1
00:15:23.752 --> 00:15:27.280
the profile, I asked few scopes, right?

9797cef4-30f5-4974-bad1-e89d789a3d50-0
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:37.587
I asked to read scopes,
I asked to read the email and profile

9797cef4-30f5-4974-bad1-e89d789a3d50-1
00:15:37.587 --> 00:15:41.840
from my Google account, right?

cec2b370-37d5-4eeb-b3be-8f2b4b374065-0
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.929
So once we land here,
so once the users sign in,

cec2b370-37d5-4eeb-b3be-8f2b4b374065-1
00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:53.356
they'll ask whether it's OK to give
permissions to ask her to read the email

cec2b370-37d5-4eeb-b3be-8f2b4b374065-2
00:15:53.356 --> 00:15:55.360
address and the profile.

355693fa-a94b-4122-9053-ae13c620c89b-0
00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.878
So in in my ID case, we'll be reading,
we might be reading email address,

355693fa-a94b-4122-9053-ae13c620c89b-1
00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:06.992
first name, last name, this information,
this information that you can read in in

355693fa-a94b-4122-9053-ae13c620c89b-2
00:16:06.992 --> 00:16:07.440
there.

7023c553-0554-4f26-a18d-694703312a79-0
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.600
So, so we need to ask them permissions.

f4f7691a-057d-4b41-ab93-9aa41a2eaae5-0
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:21.579
I mean,
they will ask because we requested the

f4f7691a-057d-4b41-ab93-9aa41a2eaae5-1
00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:27.120
scopes and then once it completed.

319677c8-ca61-4c2c-9fd1-9f087f1ba896-0
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.680
So this is this is one thing, right?

3d802dbc-c6fe-4040-8bd0-98dbcb29d1ae-0
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:41.760
So the the, the Oh yeah,
**** I think I removed that.

2802cb96-1ba0-45d1-b3c0-45700e445e12-0
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.920
So current POC profile POC policy.

bf4fd317-ca4b-4143-bddd-edd2d6d7e000-0
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.160
What it does is it adds.

da650e43-e451-4e48-82dc-fa456f430d75-0
00:16:52.960 --> 00:17:04.400
So if I look for that user account,
just unfortunate that it just it's broke.

ff90ac9f-109a-4338-952f-8ac9b9b3cbe6-0
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.145
I tried to reconfigure it,
but I didn't I think I'm still missing

ff90ac9f-109a-4338-952f-8ac9b9b3cbe6-1
00:17:09.145 --> 00:17:09.840
something.

24198e6b-bf2c-4079-bd77-04da7e93b8cf-0
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.400
Maybe if I get to reconfigure it,
I'll do a demo.

5a7467ec-1570-492b-a1fd-83f227c5fc20-0
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.920
Again, a good demo for you guys.

5aad0fa7-dcd8-4b88-ab87-19f8f119b176-0
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.080
So here.

f12672a2-c65a-4bb8-b1fc-cc1884bcc18f-0
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.253
So by default,
what it will do is you can see there's

f12672a2-c65a-4bb8-b1fc-cc1884bcc18f-1
00:17:28.253 --> 00:17:31.320
one identity here for this user.

3f990d6b-2614-4f60-89f3-7ff72a6da86d-0
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.040
After you successfully give the consent,
it'll add another identity here, right?

82fefd26-39e9-4899-9388-a4e3da376807-0
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.194
So this is your local identity using your
email address,

82fefd26-39e9-4899-9388-a4e3da376807-1
00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:47.880
and you'll add another Google identity,
which is not the Gmail email address.

cd4910ab-3ee2-4e7a-b1d7-b93e9a8e863c-0
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.960
It'll be the Gmail email addresses.

8614923d-8b2a-4582-9e3e-f19ddf985bdb-0
00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:59.516
GUID will be added here as a second
identity provider, but we don't want that,

8614923d-8b2a-4582-9e3e-f19ddf985bdb-1
00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:00.160
right?

dcb2d5eb-a7b8-4a6d-bc47-6013d74525e1-0
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:08.197
What happens is if we continue with that,
if we let it add the second sign in

dcb2d5eb-a7b8-4a6d-bc47-6013d74525e1-1
00:18:08.197 --> 00:18:08.800
method.

12099c98-ab43-431c-9a75-11bf054b0493-0
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:18.480
So we have the scenario where ACEO could
be a governing person in two RT OS, right?

bcdedc16-a170-4c06-8687-9353848bac20-0
00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.160
They probably want to keep the his to
user.

f89ef6eb-917a-448b-be19-3b153fd55a4e-0
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.120
He probably want to keep 2 user accounts
for those two RTOS, right?

4eaef32e-7c1c-428b-b1f0-a8e610f6e115-0
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.360
So probably use his company email
addresses.

e4548d08-4478-4e46-a3ec-09b964ce6a36-0
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.486
He doesn't want to use his personal email
address or he he doesn't want to share

e4548d08-4478-4e46-a3ec-09b964ce6a36-1
00:18:37.486 --> 00:18:40.840
the one company email address with the
other email address.

0a61da6e-ccf8-40e4-bd88-5089aca5b13a-0
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.720
So he will keep 2 user accounts, right?

a0516e32-f3ed-4464-aa0e-a3021ea30274-0
00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.640
So for example,
if you do 100 point ID check with one

a0516e32-f3ed-4464-aa0e-a3021ea30274-1
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.920
account if if then your digital ID is
added as a second sign in method.

896889df-33fb-4478-8b32-203ed7227608-0
00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:04.153
So when you try to do the £100 ID check,
you'll complain that the user already

896889df-33fb-4478-8b32-203ed7227608-1
00:19:04.153 --> 00:19:05.840
exists, right?

2749b8f1-28e1-4a19-9f1f-4deca22e68b7-0
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.960
So we need to modify that policy.

2d830744-0264-4491-a3ea-78698a84292a-0
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.120
So when the policy comes back,
don't save it as a second identity method.

7ef80232-21bc-405e-9c76-3ae9191eb4ec-0
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.240
So we need to add A.

423319ad-a7f6-42d5-89c7-1e96fae5dc2f-0
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:27.040
So in in B to CB to C has this custom
attributes, right?

b81569ab-286b-44bf-9526-a6b179cbc0df-0
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:40.670
Where's the custom attributes here, right?

64b33d86-16a6-4390-9943-894a46388ded-0
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.990
Edge user attributes, right.

f0272e42-062c-405e-afc3-636701e36cf6-0
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:53.400
So we already added OK, so,
so there's few custom ones, right?

96609e6c-c526-41b9-bf07-95aeeeddbcce-0
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.240
So you can see, so we added that we,
we have contact ID.

71b1fcdc-22e9-45bf-91ae-cc03ca15ee10-0
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.353
So we already stamped the contact ID into
the B to C user account for tracking

71b1fcdc-22e9-45bf-91ae-cc03ca15ee10-1
00:20:06.353 --> 00:20:07.640
purposes, right?

8cd32568-d6ef-45ed-a752-0ff3065522f5-0
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:16.624
Once you sign up you will link the link
the contact in in in in CRM and once we

8cd32568-d6ef-45ed-a752-0ff3065522f5-1
00:20:16.624 --> 00:20:19.320
get the contact back to.

4a92f473-9b39-4ef0-89e6-8108d95fc391-0
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.492
B to C,
we stamp the contact ID into the user in

4a92f473-9b39-4ef0-89e6-8108d95fc391-1
00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:27.120
B to C similarly.

c1e6ac19-1579-48c3-9745-6e2aabb1fbcf-0
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:35.015
So instead of adding a sign in method,
we need to record the digital ID in in

c1e6ac19-1579-48c3-9745-6e2aabb1fbcf-1
00:20:35.015 --> 00:20:36.960
this custom attribute.

bd6706d8-7ad9-4da6-b5da-c661e07f7ea8-0
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:46.076
And then also maybe we've added another
flag called ID checked so ID checked

bd6706d8-7ad9-4da6-b5da-c661e07f7ea8-1
00:20:46.076 --> 00:20:46.600
ticked.

a078e2c0-82b2-4dcf-8657-3b1055afbe5b-0
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.720
So what that allows is you can have one
too many.

3baf6666-6af0-4af8-a9cf-a954e1aa345c-0
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.600
So you can have one digital ID connected
with two user account.

b6cdabf9-32b6-44fe-af76-825e09a26968-0
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.480
So that's for limitation then.

d45a143a-2847-4ea9-9f81-f3ea517e0789-0
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:00.680
OK.

e0000ddf-1aa5-4132-b48a-217165c0937e-0
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.320
Like digital ID will be same, right?

64d70823-78df-4b6f-b1cb-4b0ac285aded-0
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.200
Like I will not be using a different
digital ID for another RTO.

64b377ce-e1ce-40f9-90ff-99e972ef663f-0
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.280
So will that be allowed?

165bf516-164a-4fea-8245-0644ac27599b-0
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.800
Like I will have one digital ID, right?

0014496a-250a-464f-8a2d-ffd3a36f4833-0
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.920
So I'm a CEO with an RTO.

84f3f66e-1c2f-43f9-8a66-98979a96f744-0
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.200
I'll go do my 100 points verification
with one RTO.

cb63c939-8bd7-47cf-b17c-d8e523cfd033-0
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.905
So in that case my digital ID against
this user will be the same as doing for

cb63c939-8bd7-47cf-b17c-d8e523cfd033-1
00:21:23.905 --> 00:21:25.360
another RTO right?

f8462db0-e3ac-4fa6-9228-00ee6ebce13f-0
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.280
Is that allowed?

1c9fef4b-8bdd-4a4f-85b4-ffb2964499b6-0
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.960
Like same digital ID 100 point
verification is allowed across RTO?

3bf437c7-5084-4f33-84d4-1a8f589112f9-0
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.200
If you share the your user account with
RTOS then you don't have problem right?

3c6ac007-f527-4080-91e8-0c638cfa3e8b-0
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:41.280
So because your digital ID is already
done then CRM will be checked right?

435317f1-0b7b-469f-ab9d-a3ed1da5d265-0
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:47.080
So CRM won't ask them to use do the 100
point ID check again, right.

9f0f93e7-3397-4f4e-b3e1-a79db39a3de0-0
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.430
But the problem is if you have two user
accounts, so you have two contacts,

9f0f93e7-3397-4f4e-b3e1-a79db39a3de0-1
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.120
2 user accounts as well.

c03063da-8952-482e-af20-e1e2f722ff3d-0
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.640
Normally digital ID is using our personal
email IDs, right?

417dacc5-4e70-40be-b9c0-4e75110dbe97-0
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:04.360
We won't be using official IDs like
issued by companies or any other thing.

75541541-2d6a-4a44-bfeb-c34d5f267d59-0
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.840
Yeah, that's fine.

a81434e7-8226-4af8-9f62-fe5ec444e16e-0
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.129
So,
so you don't have to use the same email

a81434e7-8226-4af8-9f62-fe5ec444e16e-1
00:22:08.129 --> 00:22:10.680
address as the email address you sign in,
Right.

0b70d638-78b0-4988-93a5-5c27d331db5c-0
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.040
OK.

f4102174-8bfb-48b1-af55-9c40a9f0ff80-0
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.153
So for example,
I could be logging into

f4102174-8bfb-48b1-af55-9c40a9f0ff80-1
00:22:15.153 --> 00:22:19.240
ascarusingmydinoco.germany@ascar.
com dot AU.

0829f132-c8b4-4882-8368-3abe80af7f71-0
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:19.560
Yep.

2e1ba106-ae4f-4275-b573-115468628c95-0
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:26.240
But I can sign into my digital ID with my
Gmail email address, right?

36c83aaa-077b-43d3-9df2-aa50f25734c3-0
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.000
OK.

522e1e1a-c234-4baa-9ccd-9bae43de800c-0
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:27.240
Yeah.

7b6eda33-5db6-4957-95b9-a912196d15d0-0
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.640
But when the request comes back,
so I record.

3b675ecb-c947-493f-9d08-a646c68730f8-0
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.320
Yeah, not the email address.

c4ddec4f-ce21-4c0e-87fe-ddf4f6da8898-0
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.280
I mean,
we can record the email address as well.

0f751115-8de2-4bf9-8eb9-b7b4cb384569-0
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.080
This is the, this is so we, we, we.

4531dd0a-f796-422a-a739-710a06393586-0
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.200
So I think this is for you guys to think,
right?

e5e7889a-92af-49ab-b22b-a29fdd82bb75-0
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.160
How do we want to record the digital ID?

46c22eaa-3d8c-4bed-ac9c-10c2b4061c87-0
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.913
So are we going to record the digital ID
as attributes of a contact or are we

46c22eaa-3d8c-4bed-ac9c-10c2b4061c87-1
00:22:51.913 --> 00:22:56.000
going to have a separate entity link to
the contact, right?

90a28a31-2507-4e4a-8149-1f391a6bb872-0
00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.687
So,
So what need to happen is after digital,

90a28a31-2507-4e4a-8149-1f391a6bb872-1
00:23:00.687 --> 00:23:08.242
when the digital ID comes back to B to C,
so we need B to C need to go make the API

90a28a31-2507-4e4a-8149-1f391a6bb872-2
00:23:08.242 --> 00:23:15.527
calls to populate the digital ID entity
or the additional attributes against the

90a28a31-2507-4e4a-8149-1f391a6bb872-3
00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:22.362
contact so that that will have so we
won't touch the contacts primary email

90a28a31-2507-4e4a-8149-1f391a6bb872-4
00:23:22.362 --> 00:23:25.960
address that will remain whatever it is.

b7e24ed9-c660-45a1-81d2-586c661f8f4b-0
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.960
And you might have a digital ID email
address, right?

1fdeb8ce-7d1a-470a-8cf1-b0db17516dfa-0
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.400
You might have a digital ID mobile number.

dda43ef4-65de-4ac1-870f-da19967baafd-0
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.600
Because you, you can't really,
you had a good point, right?

15970b9d-e246-4f4c-84f7-ac2846db405a-0
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.129
You can't really replace the primary
email address with the digital ID email

15970b9d-e246-4f4c-84f7-ac2846db405a-1
00:23:47.129 --> 00:23:49.880
address because that could be separate,
could be different.

6ce538ba-d08e-4f75-804b-8f32f71ef1bf-0
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:50.480
Yeah.

698cc110-ad50-41bb-a894-8ae4761a4d31-0
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.286
But then you can decide what are you
going to do with the mobile number,

698cc110-ad50-41bb-a894-8ae4761a4d31-1
00:23:56.286 --> 00:23:59.520
because that mobile number could be
different as well, right.

520b6434-7a1e-46ff-9290-305c5bb23b84-0
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:05.940
So he could be logging in with the his
mobile number to ask her,

520b6434-7a1e-46ff-9290-305c5bb23b84-1
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:12.360
but his digital ID might have his
personal mobile number, right?

fe920d57-4621-4403-bc01-79df29da91e1-0
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.400
So I think it's best to keep it saved
separately.

b46bc8cd-308c-4b4e-a2a2-c9f4ac9d3eb4-0
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.160
Yeah, yeah.

1fb99aba-edb3-470d-974e-7b59813242ab-0
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.880
This is the contact and this is digital
ID and this is the link.

6e3f93a2-b7d3-4a4c-ba8d-a9bd621e31bd-0
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:31.883
And these are the attributes that we're
going to save 4 digital ID, first name,

6e3f93a2-b7d3-4a4c-ba8d-a9bd621e31bd-1
00:24:31.883 --> 00:24:33.960
last name, date of birth.

c6cb369f-594a-49c9-b66a-85de7f4b89c9-0
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.431
Maybe like some attributes like date of
birth, it can be replaced in contact,

c6cb369f-594a-49c9-b66a-85de7f4b89c9-1
00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:40.840
right?

7517cd08-649d-439d-abf4-bb53c7ed3c6f-0
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.840
Because you can't have 22 date of births.

e706be80-9d39-437f-9b93-d08243679477-0
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.482
Maybe first name, last name,
you can replace as well because that's

e706be80-9d39-437f-9b93-d08243679477-1
00:24:47.482 --> 00:24:49.640
the digital IDs, first name, last name.

4509a979-9ff4-42e6-b844-47698ad620b7-0
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.040
But some attributes,
you may need to keep it separately.

92bcbc19-0788-4484-be22-445f1f77246b-0
00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:01.731
And and then the ID, the digital ID,
the GUID of the digital ID, yeah,

92bcbc19-0788-4484-be22-445f1f77246b-1
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:06.560
as you said that's need important to
important to save it.

16f522b1-81b4-476c-913d-6d3531bfb7f8-0
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.600
I think that's pretty much it for
digitally part.

0a7a0f1a-123c-4979-829a-18dbc81c330b-0
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.018
How do we configure this on the profile
Denuka, like for sign up sign in,

0a7a0f1a-123c-4979-829a-18dbc81c330b-1
00:25:25.018 --> 00:25:29.720
we go and enable Azure ADB to see right
on the portal setting for this one.

c9e95796-25f5-400e-b4ba-6c2add96e9ee-0
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.920
How we are gonna do Yeah,
So good question.

23867375-6247-4369-a887-734871d0a863-0
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.520
So if you go to your you guys call this
Power Portal Studio, right?

b4e22d9c-36f4-46a8-8835-9f6c029341cf-0
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:48.838
Go to Power Portal Studio and add another
manual planning,

b4e22d9c-36f4-46a8-8835-9f6c029341cf-1
00:25:48.838 --> 00:25:54.760
not sharing because because it was stolen.

55c5cf02-fe9f-4c86-914d-fe83329b0227-0
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.120
So you can add multiple B to C providers,
right?

809e8ddc-500f-484f-891a-44f2cadc599c-0
00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.360
Yeah.

8df8104b-bc33-42f1-84a9-6fa80a5dfde0-0
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.698
So for example,
now we have the policy that we've been

8df8104b-bc33-42f1-84a9-6fa80a5dfde0-1
00:26:05.698 --> 00:26:09.695
using is from an annual planning
perspective,

8df8104b-bc33-42f1-84a9-6fa80a5dfde0-2
00:26:09.695 --> 00:26:14.040
the real goal is to stand brand priority
budgets.

a488c56e-2763-4102-a9e2-83e05bf1ddaa-0
00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:26.880
But yeah,
define SOW to establish ticketed time.

c2fb9a8e-7a5c-48ad-b5ce-a2808e154d0c-0
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:32.600
We had the proofing as the policy, right?

2ad0710f-af09-4ee8-843a-666d96651225-0
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:38.586
If you go here and if you go to identity
and the same thing that we did the other

2ad0710f-af09-4ee8-843a-666d96651225-1
00:26:38.586 --> 00:26:39.320
day, right?

3521999b-ee9a-4851-909c-fbcdc1a21b0f-0
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:46.263
So, so you add,
you can add another provider, OK,

3521999b-ee9a-4851-909c-fbcdc1a21b0f-1
00:26:46.263 --> 00:26:57.234
So that could be AB to C and you can name
it like proofing, right or whatever,

3521999b-ee9a-4851-909c-fbcdc1a21b0f-2
00:26:57.234 --> 00:27:00.290
whatever it is, right.

dd5157ca-08e1-4cc1-bd0f-9d3dbf87b7e9-0
00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.890
And then you fill out this information.

990c50b2-4be4-4e91-a814-12ccbfa91c04-0
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.680
You use the same plant ID as the one you
use domain, right?

8dd6a1ee-979f-4a0a-8fc4-a25d9b87c220-0
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.640
And then you add authority URL.

65e8a4b3-d240-40eb-9d76-a11c0803e4ea-0
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.960
Remember that URL had the policy in
between.

6a0da064-0b56-4c68-b4a4-05f3483ff682-0
00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.200
Let's go back here.

3f636ec5-60a2-49c6-804c-c40b92e4967a-0
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:22.800
So here.

afb7ea82-919b-4afa-8e70-aba838bc7e07-0
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.960
So in the second one, you add so the,
the these bits are the same.

1f1cdca0-797a-4347-9f82-3630d0b3edc9-0
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.120
This is the tenant ID.

d366f129-b3d3-400f-b16f-c89f24efd006-0
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.640
And what you need to change is the policy,
this policy name, right?

cf719877-ac28-47cb-8ffb-3863601d8a6c-0
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.640
And ID is the same.

4dec8910-5434-4bd7-8b63-71d4918db1ae-0
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.160
So I guess and this is generated by
portal, right?

0f94e6ba-6808-4f9f-b633-31c0f8ea3d7c-0
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:40.880
Yeah.

aeb30944-6c86-49e6-b1ca-ced4a8a3644b-0
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.440
And then you need to change this.

8cbe8f2e-2b0f-4fae-9dd5-5edc8f9fe6f0-0
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.320
You don't have a password reset for that.

3d27d730-d91e-4e59-9070-4aeefb03ef29-0
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:51.953
It's only the the proofing policy here
and same thing here, proofing policy,

3d27d730-d91e-4e59-9070-4aeefb03ef29-1
00:27:51.953 --> 00:27:52.520
right?

7357a409-aced-45bb-86b5-caa6bd5fcabe-0
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.120
Yeah.

4b75ef6b-2ebd-4bef-bafc-aade075e149b-0
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.960
And then I think in these settings you
don't need external logout.

2354dad6-029d-4955-be5e-004a2dfb5594-0
00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.400
None of these need to be enabled, right?

8d1fb0ca-ac15-4eb9-8eea-e8a35ac2d52e-0
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.480
It's just a provider.

5c7948c7-99ac-4c4b-bd64-51f905ddbb45-0
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:11.157
And so once you enable that,
because you said this to default,

5c7948c7-99ac-4c4b-bd64-51f905ddbb45-1
00:28:11.157 --> 00:28:15.040
it won't show up in the portal, right?

709c87e1-0e57-444b-b866-019bf147bb74-0
00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.560
It will be hidden.

f71df5af-3818-4df0-ac36-14a9cdfa9afd-0
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.320
So you can follow the same logic that
you've done here, right?

3b2c122f-1cd0-4c4c-abc8-42a01d53adfb-0
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.840
So I think rather rather did this.

f18c42ae-e89e-48e9-924b-65eebf772edb-0
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.854
So this link,
the way that you generate the link here,

f18c42ae-e89e-48e9-924b-65eebf772edb-1
00:28:34.854 --> 00:28:40.320
you can generate the link in the same way
to redirect to the proofing policy.

9fa77594-ebcc-43cd-aa0d-f8ab351c134d-0
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.520
OK, yeah, right.

0634ca82-33eb-4e1a-85d7-5b3febaa1e37-0
00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.400
So I I think the way that is done rather
read the configuration.

1549719f-0722-4028-b8f4-24769d08ddf8-0
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.989
So these get saved,
identity provider settings get saved into

1549719f-0722-4028-b8f4-24769d08ddf8-1
00:28:50.989 --> 00:28:51.800
site settings.

f3467477-79d5-45eb-b6f0-631a840b9d7b-0
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:57.242
Yeah,
I think she rented the this URL using the

f3467477-79d5-45eb-b6f0-631a840b9d7b-1
00:28:57.242 --> 00:28:58.760
site settings.

3162672c-ecfb-44be-9215-094c36cb13be-0
00:28:59.240 --> 00:28:59.880
OK, yeah.

ae7aef52-39af-470b-9bd1-6523adbef0b2-0
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.303
So so in in your profile page,
you would have a button,

ae7aef52-39af-470b-9bd1-6523adbef0b2-1
00:29:04.303 --> 00:29:09.099
similar button here,
the link generated similar to the sign up

ae7aef52-39af-470b-9bd1-6523adbef0b2-2
00:29:09.099 --> 00:29:09.480
link.

99855bdf-091c-44e6-b8f3-c0baedaf34e9-0
00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.200
All right.

28596e8a-5934-45b8-9a89-f5a5d4fb8fe7-0
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.800
Yeah, for the proof proofing, right.

87d2e8c5-9179-45d3-a752-8fffeca40416-0
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.346
So,
so when the user hit the proofing button,

87d2e8c5-9179-45d3-a752-8fffeca40416-1
00:29:15.346 --> 00:29:21.590
so the user will land on that policy and
by the time it won't ask you to So like

87d2e8c5-9179-45d3-a752-8fffeca40416-2
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.519
like here, it won't ask you to log in.

0234f7ab-172d-4479-aa24-c9290c8b1ac2-0
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.234
Yeah,
it will land on that link page directly

0234f7ab-172d-4479-aa24-c9290c8b1ac2-1
00:29:27.234 --> 00:29:29.160
because the user's already logged in.

05de78c5-5e37-4e1b-84fc-ec173457c1de-0
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:30.440
Yep.

68f54efc-450e-4821-b809-210b017804d6-0
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.520
Yeah,
that's how the integration would happen.

594a0dff-7dbc-4537-90ec-6b3a043e648d-0
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:47.320
OK Yeah, if you guys have,
I think that's all the.

4c4d1ab0-9bfb-4c4d-9afc-62327d148852-0
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:54.693
So I'm going to do a OK,
because I was hoping to do the sort of

4c4d1ab0-9bfb-4c4d-9afc-62327d148852-1
00:29:54.693 --> 00:29:57.160
the demo in 16 minute.

45573d06-5bb7-49cc-a832-86b3d773c1a9-0
00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:04.960
So you guys have time to ask questions
about the demo in this handover session.

a94dcb6f-64b7-479e-91aa-ef7a33987cc0-0
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.440
But unfortunately demo is after this.

6f24605d-1205-4722-93fa-b861b2c2b91f-0
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:09.560
Yeah.

8489d23a-1ac3-48c5-bdd8-cf20e74b5cb7-0
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.920
So maybe I mean, we have time tomorrow,
we can set up another half an hour.

799f2e1a-f5c9-4ba7-bf65-a3ce2d2715b6-0
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:18.440
Yeah.

71cebf73-5c46-49ef-947c-4425bb0d5e85-0
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.080
Because there's there's no point of doing
the demo here right now because I have to

71cebf73-5c46-49ef-947c-4425bb0d5e85-1
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:23.720
do demo again.

03faf9ed-5d42-42c7-9716-3b942ffe5417-0
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.987
Yeah,
we can probably if you guys think you you

03faf9ed-5d42-42c7-9716-3b942ffe5417-1
00:30:27.987 --> 00:30:33.305
need, you have questions,
We'll set up another half an hour to go

03faf9ed-5d42-42c7-9716-3b942ffe5417-2
00:30:33.305 --> 00:30:35.320
through tomorrow morning.

16231188-bdd4-46d2-80a0-9ef743c132ca-0
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.800
We'll do another half an hour Tanuka
recording that demo tomorrow morning.

a2855397-fa98-4adb-a5d6-144dddb26881-0
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.200
I have a physio appointment,
so I'll be away for probably one hour.

1adcbc40-8de6-4ff3-a6c2-ae3ec8157cd1-0
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.080
That's OK.

ea3f2bfe-bdd2-4c53-a9ba-6dca93f29530-0
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:46.680
Whenever you're on.

a678404c-daf2-4502-b659-66c20cc585e2-0
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.520
Maybe if you can do afternoon.

70266434-9f3e-4b4c-990a-edaac6296bd4-0
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.560
Yeah, I can do afternoon.

3e1098a0-354a-48a8-8cf1-650be28c7162-0
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.760
OK, we can do that.
