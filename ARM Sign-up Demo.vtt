df88a891-c7d0-40a0-87e3-5c98c1e6bb26-0
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.964
Cool,
I'll probably get started with the figma

df88a891-c7d0-40a0-87e3-5c98c1e6bb26-1
00:00:06.964 --> 00:00:09.120
that Abby has created.

42ee2938-5058-425c-b984-d10c572fdd9d-0
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.640
So so the what I'll be demoing is just
the B to C part.

88416db7-c123-43ee-86a6-bb0a6b38071f-0
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.456
So,
but so the navigation will start from

88416db7-c123-43ee-86a6-bb0a6b38071f-1
00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:24.240
from the main page of the portal.

2e3f406c-c477-4f04-940e-3f9f1b6dd30d-0
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.886
So someone might hit the sign up button
first and if we are any selected, yes,

2e3f406c-c477-4f04-940e-3f9f1b6dd30d-1
00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:36.960
then we will land on this B to C screen.

ca4bb3cd-dc2b-48a0-b823-9459e7c7066a-0
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.120
So that's where we're going to start our
demo from.

bae0de45-cba5-402a-8962-a9d55986f022-0
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.735
So at the moment,
so we don't have that additional bits in

bae0de45-cba5-402a-8962-a9d55986f022-1
00:00:46.735 --> 00:00:47.320
the portal.

9db1350f-63ec-4227-a4b8-a322d0496e13-0
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.657
So I've got this button directing
straight to B to C,

9db1350f-63ec-4227-a4b8-a322d0496e13-1
00:00:53.657 --> 00:01:02.054
but in the future there'll be an
additional step in the portal and then

9db1350f-63ec-4227-a4b8-a322d0496e13-2
00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:03.920
we'll land here.

0d66a886-607d-4760-8b84-a536803042ae-0
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.680
So so when we come here.

9751017e-c6a0-45d1-8f11-1d974a6a25a5-0
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.362
So the way I sort of implemented it is to
be able to backward compatible with the

9751017e-c6a0-45d1-8f11-1d974a6a25a5-1
00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:20.680
current ARN setup for Qi.

8244b1e6-7696-42c7-b340-55d330e7b723-0
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.370
But when we're ready,
we can change the API to sort of just use

8244b1e6-7696-42c7-b340-55d330e7b723-1
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.120
the generic KRN and not.

29107bdf-b818-478d-a32c-e530ad099a77-0
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.720
So what I'm currently doing is when
someone enters ARN here.

35aa6b7c-ec60-47c2-bc64-c5b49993ee69-0
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.745
So I'll first look at the QIARN table and
if it is not found then I'll fall back to

35aa6b7c-ec60-47c2-bc64-c5b49993ee69-1
00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:46.800
the ARN of the contact.

e121430f-b6ea-4d73-a08c-979ba5d582dd-0
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.800
Excellent.

644d3bb2-1c33-4825-bb4f-709afbb39312-0
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.520
So if it is not found, then it's error.

0709cc43-884a-4529-97a4-28da37789596-0
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.211
So ARN is not found and and so Janoka,
just so I'm clear,

0709cc43-884a-4529-97a4-28da37789596-1
00:01:54.211 --> 00:02:00.520
if it does find it in the Qi table,
it would then prompt for date of birth as

0709cc43-884a-4529-97a4-28da37789596-2
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.160
well because it knows what it's meant to
do.

d26ecac3-def8-4a53-bb1e-1cefe9b6e2ea-0
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.360
Yeah.

3f6bd5c0-1d10-4d02-9ba5-6540480dcc4e-0
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.760
Cool, cool.

fd956095-cb03-42f4-8dae-9683570443aa-0
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.400
Let me let me find ARN.

0900beca-e402-4395-ba27-6de202d91606-0
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:19.840
So for example to this one,
this one is hasn't been signed up.

8431368e-f2c5-427a-958a-cc4d4b616437-0
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.200
I'll just use this ARN.

8694ae24-a4b3-4f25-99ed-6ed7a917e639-0
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:30.178
So this is so impacted individual,
one of the impacted individuals in the RN

8694ae24-a4b3-4f25-99ed-6ed7a917e639-1
00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:30.800
table.

8b685a0f-9d26-450b-8b49-03ca89df6814-0
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:44.480
So what I'll do is I'll go to the RN,
put the put the RN and do continue.

d8e92eed-7961-4286-a3b0-4622b6b96299-0
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.522
So now what will happen is B to C will
call the Web API and the Web API will

d8e92eed-7961-4286-a3b0-4622b6b96299-1
00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:57.760
check whether they are in exist ARN in
this case exist.

07764c35-150e-49d7-96ef-c41ba7e5fc64-0
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.360
So it shows the Qi sign up.

afe4be12-f097-48d1-9971-7689b694e6fd-0
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.760
Yeah, perfect.

2e3fa361-1139-4a3b-b738-446e6174be57-0
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.716
So for example,
so because we don't have the,

2e3fa361-1139-4a3b-b738-446e6174be57-1
00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:13.160
we don't have the ARN attribute yet the
the proper 1 yet.

a9069eea-67cb-4877-b677-cf788f8799e8-0
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:23.320
So I've I've configured that to be the
contact ID for for for time being.

6b44adbd-89ee-4154-aa7c-dc446de42d1e-0
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.200
So for example if I go back and this one
here.

324764c0-d0e4-46a8-a82a-3bbe678d5c17-0
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:39.510
So what will happen is if I enter the
contact ID instead,

324764c0-d0e4-46a8-a82a-3bbe678d5c17-1
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.560
so I'll return back to portal and I'll
start signing up.

f7f55cd9-769f-4b76-82df-b9e51036e990-0
00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:03.280
So now BCRN so that should not find in
the RN table.

90eb6be6-6714-4a08-b5c0-8d7bd7dcb0ad-0
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.320
It doesn't have the date of date of birth.

bab691bd-4101-4aa8-b973-d730b092d7f2-0
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.520
So this these are two complete different
sign up flows.

af0cd971-fdac-4be3-8393-49d43a096f26-0
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.800
We can continue.

5beafd11-1c94-4e99-bcf8-c62de41f5f55-0
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.600
So let me, let's continue with this.

1be7059a-d017-4a33-8f17-f9b3aa3d3fff-0
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.111
And just while you're doing that,
so we need to add like we haven't added

1be7059a-d017-4a33-8f17-f9b3aa3d3fff-1
00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:24.757
in dev,
we haven't added an ARN field to the

1be7059a-d017-4a33-8f17-f9b3aa3d3fff-2
00:04:24.757 --> 00:04:25.640
contact record.

d7d2daa6-2c8e-4624-9135-68dd13767c4d-0
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.154
And when we do, you'll have to well,
someone will have to update this logic to

d7d2daa6-2c8e-4624-9135-68dd13767c4d-1
00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:30.400
call against that ARN field.

8f46727b-3df1-4c41-80d0-dea01e284f00-0
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.880
Yeah.

e23ccdc8-03b2-46f7-8c9c-8e2f03386035-0
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.320
So the place to update is the API, not BC.

89ce1899-fe8b-487a-b3c6-ce55675652c1-0
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.200
Yeah, Yep.

99d44508-924d-4b64-b6db-5eaf42532da0-0
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.560
Gotcha.

2e7e31f0-b9b4-444a-a717-f1f92eff538c-0
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.200
Yeah.

905d6da1-d076-4cfc-a7dc-37ebdcf26778-0
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.880
So if I go to a email,
if I produce have an email address.

1a0ba502-fb45-4d5f-9167-212a69e1bd76-0
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.520
So I'll show this working full end to end.

f0d11c1d-9ff9-44a1-b74c-eaa21dcfe4ed-0
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.170
So I'll verify the email address so I'll
be as requested.

72d66e80-d876-454d-a91d-4bec6036c3f7-0
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.810
So I put the ARN here.

3879379a-d351-41de-b56e-04e4feb59e4d-0
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.850
So that's the ARN they entered in the in
the 1st place for the reference.

ff5ef0c5-4f03-4f1b-880e-f40fa852d5a9-0
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:27.471
But so while the email come through,
I think the only thing that we need to be

ff5ef0c5-4f03-4f1b-880e-f40fa852d5a9-1
00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:32.462
mindful here, Jamie,
So if we start generating the RN

ff5ef0c5-4f03-4f1b-880e-f40fa852d5a9-2
00:05:32.462 --> 00:05:37.453
sequentially,
there is a potential that someone could

ff5ef0c5-4f03-4f1b-880e-f40fa852d5a9-3
00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:38.840
mistype the RN.

1259479c-1930-43a7-a25f-20012f68d78d-0
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.000
Like for example, if my RN is 1234,
but we've generated 1235 as well, right?

98365de9-7e3a-4775-92c0-52413e39a082-0
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.400
So if I accidentally put 1235,
then there's nothing blocking.

e6b0b2e5-38ca-4f8c-a3db-0902671884a0-0
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.120
I'm registering with 12345.

57cd6671-3710-492e-a6dc-07d2a37a5941-0
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.080
Yeah.

ca3267c9-e146-4d2b-b425-aa09fa8bcd0c-0
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.520
Cool.

c866604e-fc8c-4534-a225-d0e4c3051fc7-0
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.320
Yeah, We might need to work through that.

571e75ca-d79c-435b-b683-3b07871f757d-0
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.600
It's almost like a bit.

c530589a-0c4b-4dc2-bddb-9ebd47e1522f-0
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.440
We might need a bit more complexity in
there.

9856ce9f-d1d5-4e39-b1e6-a93183cdc0bf-0
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.616
Yeah, I think, I think we need, I mean,
this is exactly why we put the date of

9856ce9f-d1d5-4e39-b1e6-a93183cdc0bf-1
00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:12.600
birth into impacted individuals.

003be36a-0318-42b1-aee1-39862c8bbb4e-0
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.040
So this is the secondary challenge, right?

f31f1962-7714-405c-9200-d3b4c69decc1-0
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.760
Yeah, Yeah.

8d199e38-e75f-4eaa-a302-61897909c7aa-0
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.200
And so we need to think about some other
challenge,

8d199e38-e75f-4eaa-a302-61897909c7aa-1
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.172
maybe like a very simple challenge like
mask,

8d199e38-e75f-4eaa-a302-61897909c7aa-2
00:06:22.172 --> 00:06:25.080
first name and last name to just to
confirm.

ee36e325-981e-46be-a4ff-fe0f1e10cc2b-0
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.035
Yeah, yeah,
something simple or like we can go more

ee36e325-981e-46be-a4ff-fe0f1e10cc2b-1
00:06:29.035 --> 00:06:32.640
complicated, like, yeah,
secondary codes into SMS.

572b0748-86aa-4686-b151-3333228a1b72-0
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.760
And that's what I was just thinking,
like a confirmation pin or something.

7f94d0fb-0e4c-4d59-8b64-f959df26e339-0
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.484
But but that's starting to now they've
got multiple bits of information and it's

7f94d0fb-0e4c-4d59-8b64-f959df26e339-1
00:06:39.484 --> 00:06:40.680
gonna get a bit confusing.

2cb3a1dc-e6d1-467c-a10d-cb85987eb675-0
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.400
I'm sure you won't like that as a design
element.

547fcbd9-ffc7-4490-bc4d-deb1d76d223c-0
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.040
So yeah.

fba4e44b-e8da-4cac-a77b-7281c304b683-0
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.400
But let's unpack that one a little bit.

101fac53-b25e-405a-984e-c89d792a3113-0
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.762
Maybe we can add a bit more complexity
that maybe introduces some of their name

101fac53-b25e-405a-984e-c89d792a3113-1
00:06:50.762 --> 00:06:52.640
in some way into it as well.

cffc03e2-18e5-4304-9613-8d1e9483d2c2-0
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.160
Yeah.

32f9f9e4-c066-4a76-8031-e62749ee9031-0
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.320
Like to confirm, just a second check.

123bd15e-d348-48f0-9018-5b43bd04cc4a-0
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.280
So if you, I mean,
we're not gonna reveal the name.

13755049-6453-47fe-be55-554543a7956d-0
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.960
No, we're just gonna mask it.

7d9c805c-1bf7-4e6d-9040-a8116b914a5d-0
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.360
Yeah.

de22f2ee-fbf0-472a-b1a9-b49a09ca413b-0
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.006
It's kind of like,
Are you sure that's your ARN or something

de22f2ee-fbf0-472a-b1a9-b49a09ca413b-1
00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:04.440
like that?

6129b004-56ac-41f5-8d76-2909b341039c-0
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that sort of thing.

e2024947-e32b-48cf-a100-0a48a14c560d-0
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:33.370
And now I should be able to sign up with
the password,

e2024947-e32b-48cf-a100-0a48a14c560d-1
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:40.860
prompt me for MFA as the next step.

3be26c8e-0cb4-4631-8f50-d6ec1297b739-0
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.640
Yeah.

e832f7cc-45f8-40cc-8a5b-bd8882939e5b-0
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:13.970
So users signed up, Yeah.

b70490a3-2cb3-435c-a9ef-df1b1bc04bc0-0
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.090
So currently it sort of,
I think we need to change the entry point.

a3a50f84-3ed2-497e-b12e-7dc113c516d6-0
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:25.655
So we came from that URL,
that button that we clicked on had the

a3a50f84-3ed2-497e-b12e-7dc113c516d6-1
00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:29.680
return URL last impacted individual
dashboard.

bff9896f-872a-48e8-8635-bb9018b2f30a-0
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.240
So this is what I was referring to the
other day, right.

728f0d63-c7a4-481b-a90c-1a7a49f70f41-0
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.720
So we need to get them in a sort of a
invisible common landing place.

2fc37246-8cb7-4446-8cbd-e6f926b912a9-0
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.938
And according to what you described,
Jamie,

2fc37246-8cb7-4446-8cbd-e6f926b912a9-1
00:08:39.938 --> 00:08:44.840
they preferred a dashboard that need to
happen on the portal side.

0cb2d83d-e942-423a-888e-5f4ad297db2b-0
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:57.680
So once redirected so so if we go to the
contact, if I should be able to refresh.

2029a09a-a12a-47f9-ad86-68a8322e45e5-0
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:08.840
So you can see the for that contact login
enabled and the links created.

19ec9a72-674e-4c74-be48-b7fcd69841a2-0
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:18.560
So so we can do the same thing just to
completion of the demo go through with

19ec9a72-674e-4c74-be48-b7fcd69841a2-1
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.480
the the.

b69b7d01-edbc-4ec6-89af-34acd10ae8a2-0
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:30.030
So let's open up the 41, this account,
this account,

b69b7d01-edbc-4ec6-89af-34acd10ae8a2-1
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:42.080
it doesn't have web authentication
enabled and also it doesn't have role.

bad1a869-2504-49ba-abf9-f8916a4f5d1c-0
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.240
So that's how BB to C works, right?

367377a6-510e-47f6-8690-f7fe042c0b5a-0
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.527
So, so,
so I'm not basing that fork in in the B

367377a6-510e-47f6-8690-f7fe042c0b5a-1
00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:57.680
to C to whether to show the impacted
individual form or the generic form.

e53e1dcd-68e0-4436-bb67-cda8fb90633e-0
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.428
It's not at the moment,
it's not based on the web role because

e53e1dcd-68e0-4436-bb67-cda8fb90633e-1
00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:10.187
the way that be impacted individual works
right now is the web role get assigned at

e53e1dcd-68e0-4436-bb67-cda8fb90633e-2
00:10:10.187 --> 00:10:12.360
the end during the sign up.

62a8595f-0464-41c6-9005-91130f11c4bb-0
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.200
It doesn't get assigned during the import,
but in the future,

62a8595f-0464-41c6-9005-91130f11c4bb-1
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.480
like when you move into the generic flow.

0bf62ac8-b232-472c-81c2-3d837ac3f300-0
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.680
So the web role need to be assigned prior.

15e0883b-0ace-4015-8583-40f83b5f91de-0
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.008
But I kept it assuming that we're not
going to touch QYQY is going to stay as

15e0883b-0ace-4015-8583-40f83b5f91de-1
00:10:32.008 --> 00:10:32.360
it is.

34739f82-3647-41c1-935c-e0f9b4fdb6ed-0
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.960
So there's nothing no changes required to
use this sign up flow.

10aba13b-dfa7-468f-8c68-dbad957b54cc-0
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.160
So it it it doesn't that decision is not
based on the web role.

9a552425-2d56-4d4f-8e7b-6196833d9b08-0
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.280
It's based on whether it's found in the
ARN table.

9c43d5a6-6da0-4b58-94e8-01ca380919cd-0
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:52.109
If it is found in the ARN table,
it's considered as a impacted individual

9c43d5a6-6da0-4b58-94e8-01ca380919cd-1
00:10:52.109 --> 00:10:57.000
instead of just checking the the just
checking the role.

60dd3174-dac7-4340-88dd-560319ae9d3d-0
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:08.240
So if you go back and they will sign up
again.

65cf948d-2c0b-4cd1-93a7-2961860d8917-0
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.040
So can I just ask Danoka what you're
saying?

fb74cfc3-769d-4856-bb17-5fb15566d1b6-0
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.809
There is if we try and if we,
if we move towards Qi kind of working in

fb74cfc3-769d-4856-bb17-5fb15566d1b6-1
00:11:23.809 --> 00:11:28.522
the same way every,
every time we almost generate an IRM,

fb74cfc3-769d-4856-bb17-5fb15566d1b6-2
00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:30.960
we create a web role for that.

6b7267e7-b0bb-4264-b80c-f2330613ca4c-0
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.194
Like every contact would kind of have a
web role and the new solution would just

6b7267e7-b0bb-4264-b80c-f2330613ca4c-1
00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:39.532
interrogate that web role and the portal
would pick that up and direct them to the

6b7267e7-b0bb-4264-b80c-f2330613ca4c-2
00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.160
right place.

2c45d749-70ee-47fe-b613-ff5780194817-0
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.040
Yes.

59ce3d16-ae97-4ae3-9705-35f199752797-0
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.109
So, so, so in the future,
with the generic care and flow,

59ce3d16-ae97-4ae3-9705-35f199752797-1
00:11:47.109 --> 00:11:52.480
so every contact should have at least one
web role.

b6646296-b4bd-42ad-b282-d1eb16fcd5a3-0
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.040
Yeah.

186eb93d-547f-4711-b19d-25dd1e5eb6f0-0
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.520
Yep.

52df76e5-04d9-4cd5-a8e0-84d1e64215b4-0
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.080
Like a starter role.

6a9e584e-1a11-4639-89c6-11540e67da42-0
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:55.920
Yeah.

50c5c53f-1359-47bd-abf0-a2ffd6cbddc6-0
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.520
Basic role, yeah.

6e9a8e7c-e574-4b7b-a68a-5e942f14b526-0
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.360
Yeah.

2d59193c-d287-4b6e-b516-174827d31c47-0
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.840
I mean, not really starting role,
it's some role, right?

a50f74bb-08d2-41a0-a1b4-6e28d1b8853f-0
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.760
So yeah, for example, that.

f9471044-fb21-47ed-9eb7-ac430590312a-0
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:09.017
So in the future,
we need to extend the import solution,

f9471044-fb21-47ed-9eb7-ac430590312a-1
00:12:09.017 --> 00:12:10.880
load the RNS, Yep.

2bb11934-f99a-4c34-a388-c7e4f616f813-0
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.400
Load the contacts, Yep.

75a49f3d-f300-4c41-b2e5-42cc3b3bc5c1-0
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.960
And add the impacted individual web role
to every contact.

bd61c58b-d5ab-44c1-a3bd-b384982beefa-0
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.520
Yep.

c6041f37-8b9c-44f7-946d-8b03eefa7c9f-0
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.870
And if we approve an expression of
interest to become a market entrant,

c6041f37-8b9c-44f7-946d-8b03eefa7c9f-1
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.840
then we would have it at a market entrant
web role.

b56d23b0-7d84-4fe2-89bf-b7125adf4145-0
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.360
And so then,
then they do the generic sort of sign up

b56d23b0-7d84-4fe2-89bf-b7125adf4145-1
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.084
and then when they land it knows here's
your here's your priority web role

b56d23b0-7d84-4fe2-89bf-b7125adf4145-2
00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:33.840
effectively.

414e1bf7-95b7-4d65-9fa3-f2c346257aec-0
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.800
And here's the page we should show you
exactly so.

2b7335a8-1955-49a0-8ed1-b47686098793-0
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.320
So agent could be different or or or yeah,
student record could be different.

af4bee26-1c4d-409c-b1b8-a72e1c7b5b57-0
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.080
Yeah, roles.

9e9bbf0a-5043-4c90-bd32-2e711bf3f746-0
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.543
So depending on the role and their
preferences that that invisible landing

9e9bbf0a-5043-4c90-bd32-2e711bf3f746-1
00:12:48.543 --> 00:12:50.640
page could handle that logic.

6766d9ff-16d2-43c3-a949-0b9e693e1fb3-0
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.000
Yep, Yep, that makes sense.

33242006-94d1-4b80-800d-293e17d00530-0
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.908
Yeah,
but but sign up will also consider the

33242006-94d1-4b80-800d-293e17d00530-1
00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:59.360
role if you have different sign up flows.

a55cc514-8881-42d7-a803-a16b9fdec662-0
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.520
But at the moment we only have two sign
up flows, right.

216c4b19-6d52-425b-8c71-4d67662fd3f9-0
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.000
So one is impacted individual,
the other is the generate.

40241b30-b939-48dd-bce2-641896a54571-0
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.360
Yep, yeah, gotcha.

02033eeb-d4d0-432f-8923-291e54d73d82-0
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.320
Let me add a new email address.

e2ff5c0e-f47b-425b-ab0c-d6b4033d4926-0
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.870
So I've been using this email address
generator.

0fe24885-e9d5-44b9-b1d5-19b219e35cfe-0
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:03.028
So it's been blocked by ASCAN so I have
to use it from my mobile and type it in

0fe24885-e9d5-44b9-b1d5-19b219e35cfe-1
00:14:03.028 --> 00:14:05.470
otherwise I could have just copy pasted
it.

fe08bc82-8e2d-4127-8d51-f417ed05ba14-0
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.630
And is that service?

dddb7923-1284-49ae-88cc-7f7d51249c22-0
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.230
Is that on on email?

9de6a811-29eb-4595-96d9-2cb60cd2ea07-0
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.270
Is that what it's called on email?

64e42e39-6bad-4483-97fe-c07ec007cba3-0
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.988
They have couple of DNS hosts,
so they generate random email addresses

64e42e39-6bad-4483-97fe-c07ec007cba3-1
00:14:20.988 --> 00:14:23.040
using those posts there.

10f75c36-f1b6-4746-a8c6-b435c31b5116-0
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.280
What's the actual service or tool like
what is it?

aa761133-4532-484e-9bac-4a483525e2e7-0
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.760
It's called temp mail, temp website,
temp mail.

38d6a4b5-51a6-4463-b84a-1b161a920f65-0
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.280
Yeah, yeah.

54f298f1-75c3-42ea-8b39-a8e347310b91-0
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:31.600
Gotcha.

9077e94e-b22d-4b9a-bcd8-f76540652ddf-0
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:31.920
Cool.

5fa22cc0-7be5-4f88-8a2a-afa06e3f599a-0
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.760
And then you're just using your mobile
for the mobile verification.

201484f7-dac3-43cd-9af6-26c4ed957d1f-0
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.080
Yeah, cool.

a9a92ee1-d26b-4867-a508-2ff5f75e5146-0
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:42.240
Great.

6cc4fcff-f7e7-4dae-a834-58031fca1095-0
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.440
Yeah, it's done.

d52c0a5e-21db-4391-be1e-085deadba455-0
00:14:47.440 --> 00:15:04.998
So I'll put a password and the date of
birth I've used for this contact is first

d52c0a5e-21db-4391-be1e-085deadba455-1
00:15:04.998 --> 00:15:07.600
of Jan 2000.

bea081f3-70a7-497b-b5ef-0aca9aba100f-0
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:23.960
Yeah.

14fd2bfa-2cb8-44db-9f5f-02be46a73cc8-0
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.360
So last for MFA,
so this is same as the previous flow.

9742ef2f-c966-49ff-b183-bb78a527daa9-0
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.174
It's kept,
kept same as what we got in production

9742ef2f-c966-49ff-b183-bb78a527daa9-1
00:15:33.174 --> 00:15:33.480
now.

977bda53-a7ba-42bc-b4d5-550fbde0c32a-0
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:40.390
But the other thing that also I would
like to highlight all the styling has

977bda53-a7ba-42bc-b4d5-550fbde0c32a-1
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:45.840
been improved as per the portal styling
the CSS star excellent.

fd197176-8cc6-4e40-9b07-1e17e5708dcb-0
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.520
I had one styling question for Abby on
the portal, but I'll leave it to the end.

6f01d772-ace9-46e1-a3d7-2c85a6036b39-0
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.600
I'll get the code.

9f0bc7d0-4631-4ba0-904e-a906cb193c5b-0
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.325
Yeah,
so because we didn't come from that

9f0bc7d0-4631-4ba0-904e-a906cb193c5b-1
00:16:21.325 --> 00:16:25.919
portal button and the dash on the portal
page,

9f0bc7d0-4631-4ba0-904e-a906cb193c5b-2
00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:31.100
we came from the sign up link from the
sign in Page.

5b5d706c-9715-4554-a1e9-ef543ed38cd5-0
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.380
So it landed me on the home page.

c4be4b9d-92c8-4335-a8cd-456156f3c20c-0
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.640
It's pretty much whatever the B to C has
been told it'll get redirected.

d0e9be9a-6720-4cb6-8221-728391257567-0
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:53.537
So if I go to the if I refresh the
contact now, so if I roll down,

d0e9be9a-6720-4cb6-8221-728391257567-1
00:16:53.537 --> 00:16:57.690
let me refresh it.

d92f3da5-33e8-457a-8507-b1dc7db53187-0
00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.010
It should have a web role.

80864577-39ec-46ca-8a8a-222c78a9b328-0
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:00.650
It's not.

349c659d-0a2a-4fb7-9232-18c34865236d-0
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.210
I'll have a look why it's not in the web
role.

7364b0b1-7ec8-4551-a001-79f721229250-0
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.948
Not I'll check why the web it should have
the abroad here, but yeah,

7364b0b1-7ec8-4551-a001-79f721229250-1
00:17:19.948 --> 00:17:23.747
so it does some something for me to have
a look,

7364b0b1-7ec8-4551-a001-79f721229250-2
00:17:23.747 --> 00:17:29.483
but it's it's it it has done the
validation of the date of birth and link

7364b0b1-7ec8-4551-a001-79f721229250-3
00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:33.360
the account to the B to C account in the
contact.

3dcd0f4d-d43e-4469-bc35-332fa416cc43-0
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.040
So it's fully functional.

764e15ed-aa6b-4771-86d2-c08a91ac89db-0
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.630
So,
so I'll kept that in a invite only branch

764e15ed-aa6b-4771-86d2-c08a91ac89db-1
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:44.320
because we don't want to merge to main
branch.

5c1e946b-570c-4f95-a65b-03b61b50b5a6-0
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.680
Main branch is the production branch.

bae9879e-03bb-4bc7-8d09-6a112b8d04f2-0
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.960
So we can keep whatever improvements that
we do going forward.

850e1ace-5e57-4c06-a668-69ccd27c01ea-0
00:17:52.200 --> 00:18:00.960
We can keep it on the invite only branch
and I think that's it.

605e4a3e-4cc4-4d5a-82c9-e2ec41e06ad5-0
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:07.333
So this is already configured in dev,
so maybe in the next, if we're happy,

605e4a3e-4cc4-4d5a-82c9-e2ec41e06ad5-1
00:18:07.333 --> 00:18:10.520
we can configure it in Devint as well.

69e2df09-531a-4b37-8f96-1f742aea5836-0
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.440
So then we have the policy in both places
dev and dev went.

59a73d44-11e6-4083-b129-20ce7eb593a7-0
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.760
Devin, could be just involvement for RMA.

9b66a763-e62e-488b-83a0-64a8ad985fcf-0
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.040
That's pretty much it.

cd0389fb-2de5-459b-bdb4-2b7ea2c5b987-0
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.320
That's brilliant.

60918d19-f1b8-4a14-a6d0-deb817402f91-0
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.160
Love it.

ee79a646-9fe4-4925-950f-0ec68cdc6a3e-0
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.880
I think it's really coming together.

d92c2771-51af-4cd2-8db3-c529572711f0-0
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.360
We'll have to figure out timing and the
web role stuff.

9ea28509-2390-49b1-b5dd-ab80e9c55a3a-0
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.010
But yeah,
I think it's sort of it's landed as you

9ea28509-2390-49b1-b5dd-ab80e9c55a3a-1
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.555
know,
with the foundations for us to be able to

9ea28509-2390-49b1-b5dd-ab80e9c55a3a-2
00:18:34.555 --> 00:18:38.160
sort of merge that together and and
implement the the one approach.

a8b32a4a-0f2b-4303-8f15-471cac3419f6-0
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.520
Really good.

4e1dab5f-067e-4012-addd-c4b9698fcedc-0
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.120
Cool.

b330aed1-d7f4-40db-b2e2-63a25aae37f6-0
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.120
Anyone else got questions?

280f9d10-bcbe-466f-82b4-210200a2f10d-0
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:43.240
Nope.

29e7d029-0e71-4a7e-958c-73edf2d7f5ee-0
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:45.800
Cool.

eb367ff1-cd00-43f6-8245-2d9693733785-0
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:46.560
Good luck.

7a2e9c57-5634-45b9-9ace-b3c8ca5851fa-0
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.680
Yes, very happy.

25d1c111-002f-4859-a4b1-821e2e833039-0
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.400
Thanks to Nuka.

b2409705-b10b-4235-a6bc-6abc6429628d-0
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.760
You can probably stop recording if you
want.

843c6a91-3f0e-49da-ac6f-1abd142aa7ed-0
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.160
Yeah, yeah.

25fb6306-b80c-4770-a81d-b829547478a0-0
00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:03.680
And my question, which I wish I'll share.
