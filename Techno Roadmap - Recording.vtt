877aaeb6-ed2e-489a-9bb1-2f9f79ddc870-0
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.000
Oh not, I don't know.

9229693e-a397-494d-8c7b-eb1b10a5cd83-0
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.920
Ah, it started.

ef053afc-8416-4230-8a49-b3444e5a63fa-0
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.280
Yep, perfect.

dbca24bf-a04d-4073-9d35-b864fdf57ee9-0
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.960
It's taking sweet dime.

651692e7-afd6-45fb-ace3-54ef493c2b1c-0
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.320
Here we go.

c4ffcd0a-2385-4e58-82f4-58f78a7b0060-0
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.800
Yep.

e174deee-0927-4ada-b4e8-eea4586d962e-0
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.496
So all right,
actually there's probably two things I

e174deee-0927-4ada-b4e8-eea4586d962e-1
00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:29.600
can open to go right from the very top.

269c1676-1851-4196-84f9-b0c5266039af-0
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.960
Go back here and also go,
what have we got here?

1c77b285-cf4c-483b-97d1-788380807e86-0
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.200
Let's just do this one in the background.

0e68e559-b834-4988-b353-bd29538ec446-0
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.542
So I think you may or may not remember we
originally, so from a very high level,

0e68e559-b834-4988-b353-bd29538ec446-1
00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:53.289
we originally sort of planned at the
start of the programme,

0e68e559-b834-4988-b353-bd29538ec446-2
00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.125
we planned to have 2 environments and we
would build separate functions in

0e68e559-b834-4988-b353-bd29538ec446-3
00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:04.883
separate environments and we'd have a
common data model and data would be

0e68e559-b834-4988-b353-bd29538ec446-4
00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:06.440
shared between them.

5d5005dc-d20a-4c7d-9d94-6b8711841e3e-0
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.144
And we kind of moved away from that,
right,

5d5005dc-d20a-4c7d-9d94-6b8711841e3e-1
00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:10.880
'cause that became just way too hard.

87c9d03a-3383-4362-85b5-3d8e20a491b6-0
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.300
And so, yeah, so we're at at a high level,
we've kind of got 2 environments still,

87c9d03a-3383-4362-85b5-3d8e20a491b6-1
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.120
which originally was sort of ARMS 01 and
ARMS 02.

ac76459d-86d8-47f1-b694-2ab52b39f70e-0
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.280
But ARMS O2 is being rebadged a little
bit to be called our Acers environment.

0a2b78d2-da5f-4a2d-9efc-e90a5c305574-0
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.680
And all that stands for is Asqua's
corporate and enabling systems.

4f8c4520-4bf4-4b7f-93a3-023e9b4c9d80-0
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.172
And so where we've got ARMS 01,
ARMS being Asqua's regulatory management

4f8c4520-4bf4-4b7f-93a3-023e9b4c9d80-1
00:01:42.172 --> 00:01:46.482
systems,
we've also got we rebadged Arms O2 to be

4f8c4520-4bf4-4b7f-93a3-023e9b4c9d80-2
00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:47.000
Acers.

432f64e0-f732-4f7a-8c78-35e01995a21f-0
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.960
So it's all corporate and enabling
systems.

eb225a59-0f68-4e15-8086-be6fa9468e51-0
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.829
We went and got another vendor called The
Factor, which you may have heard of,

eb225a59-0f68-4e15-8086-be6fa9468e51-1
00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:05.509
and they had this little ticketing system
that they'd built power platform kind of

eb225a59-0f68-4e15-8086-be6fa9468e51-2
00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.840
solution there and we're using that.

9b94877a-0769-476d-8207-17057118f35f-0
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.520
You might have heard of Tracker.

b0c10937-371b-4ede-ad3a-8a3c70099744-0
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.800
You probably logged a couple of Tracker
tickets potentially already.

16f748d9-bc00-41da-b9dd-d74f53095f1f-0
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.680
So it's just a ticketing system and it's
just being used by tech OPS right now.

5f5590a7-3387-4090-a1f4-de986148640e-0
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.825
But that the intention of tracker as a
concept was if our,

5f5590a7-3387-4090-a1f4-de986148640e-1
00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:28.579
if our data and reporting team wants to
have a ticketing system to manage their

5f5590a7-3387-4090-a1f4-de986148640e-2
00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.252
work,
we'd repurpose this tracker system and

5f5590a7-3387-4090-a1f4-de986148640e-3
00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:32.560
sort of hive them off.

7cc4d9a8-7b3a-47bc-9d02-5af3e289538e-0
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.273
And so basically it's just a support form
that you can fill out your request and it

7cc4d9a8-7b3a-47bc-9d02-5af3e289538e-1
00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:40.162
goes in and yeah,
tech OPS can manage and sort and Philtre

7cc4d9a8-7b3a-47bc-9d02-5af3e289538e-2
00:02:40.162 --> 00:02:41.679
and do all their work in there.

60449821-6114-4152-be0b-0a236ed37516-0
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.104
We've also got the factor doing a form
solution,

60449821-6114-4152-be0b-0a236ed37516-1
00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:51.355
which is really just it's a bit of a self
service build your own form,

60449821-6114-4152-be0b-0a236ed37516-2
00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:56.828
but it's with people and capability are
using that to build some of their

60449821-6114-4152-be0b-0a236ed37516-3
00:02:56.828 --> 00:03:00.600
onboarding forms and you know request new
devices,

60449821-6114-4152-be0b-0a236ed37516-4
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.000
all these sort of people and capability
forms they're building in there.

f1272332-6b69-4cfa-a283-2cdcc0bbcf1b-0
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.000
So we don't have a lot to do with ACES,
right?

526f3776-ab12-4d05-a887-804e76fd1362-0
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.040
It's off to the side.

4ceb545d-17c8-4784-9c35-0d952c9d3b2f-0
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.920
We'll do a bit of that.

12465984-32a2-45ff-9ca3-68165c83f8cd-0
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.120
It's sort of infrastructure support stuff.

741d0641-bc40-447f-9db5-d8d58dd2ee41-0
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.930
But the factors in there and the factor
is kind of working very sort of business

741d0641-bc40-447f-9db5-d8d58dd2ee41-1
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.325
front end corporate and enabling working
with that team to manage that solution

741d0641-bc40-447f-9db5-d8d58dd2ee41-2
00:03:23.325 --> 00:03:24.040
there for us.

11e6d8b8-6067-42ba-8628-d4bdea19aa3b-0
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.320
OK.

ec4b8497-97f2-40c0-927b-4c046746c2d6-0
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.707
But just if you hear people talking about
aces,

ec4b8497-97f2-40c0-927b-4c046746c2d6-1
00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:33.367
that's kind of just all of our internal
corporate and enabling solutions that

ec4b8497-97f2-40c0-927b-4c046746c2d6-2
00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:35.160
we're going to build in there.

077d48e9-4af1-40c8-813d-3f31f5244032-0
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.704
It's not external facing,
There's no external sort of portal or

077d48e9-4af1-40c8-813d-3f31f5244032-1
00:03:39.704 --> 00:03:40.600
anything for that.

52a7565f-b36a-4c79-b217-ab5e479c2986-0
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.680
It's it's purely just for sort of forms
management and ticket management.

a6f84c86-ba57-4afb-a5e6-e9282ec91a07-0
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.640
OK, so, and I just cracked that open,
right.

d5481e69-7bdd-471c-a2c9-2312037bd94c-0
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.618
So you'll see they're,
they're kind of in customer service hub

d5481e69-7bdd-471c-a2c9-2312037bd94c-1
00:03:53.618 --> 00:03:56.880
and there's a whole bunch of tickets
coming in already from tracker.

a5f5a559-07b5-4618-a5ca-437c53dbcefc-0
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.202
But it's the,
it's the Asqua Aces environment versus

a5f5a559-07b5-4618-a5ca-437c53dbcefc-1
00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:06.200
the, you know,
the arms Asqua Arms environment there.

f8161aa6-c156-4991-aca1-b78b37b029f7-0
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.309
OK,
most of our work is gonna be over in this

f8161aa6-c156-4991-aca1-b78b37b029f7-1
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:11.120
sort of side.

943b1f6f-deac-44f8-b43d-80de2271e250-0
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.560
So what is in arms so far?

d264a6dd-d4b4-47e3-8d46-986e151292fa-0
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.749
Again,
you'll have a little bit of this

d264a6dd-d4b4-47e3-8d46-986e151292fa-1
00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:18.960
knowledge from before, right.

2cbaf9be-9034-4b60-8d13-67553a120c17-0
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:25.000
But when we first sort of started and did,
did you ever meet Judy who was an aspirin?

560f89d5-a348-4d47-87cb-1e68fc78eb0f-0
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7e384a83-ac21-4112-96b7-de3bdf21d7ae-0
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.720
I was working with her for the data
migration.

11f40f1c-ce8f-431c-98fc-3f71c0381eea-0
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.040
Yeah, yeah, right.

42e6e202-192f-4deb-8fc5-d6b648ffeb78-0
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.394
So, so,
so when we sort of first kicked off,

42e6e202-192f-4deb-8fc5-d6b648ffeb78-1
00:04:32.394 --> 00:04:36.344
they were working,
Judy was working more on that TPA

42e6e202-192f-4deb-8fc5-d6b648ffeb78-2
00:04:36.344 --> 00:04:42.456
Training Product Accreditation 1 and we
had DSD in and they were working on Sims,

42e6e202-192f-4deb-8fc5-d6b648ffeb78-3
00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:45.960
which was sort of customer inquiry
management.

c04feff3-bd91-45f2-9af5-44b831d76a00-0
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.640
And so those were the 2 apps that we sort
of started with, OK.

7ad7b2e3-0acc-4ff3-8d19-5732f1d351c6-0
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.624
And so Training Product accreditation
still called TPA,

7ad7b2e3-0acc-4ff3-8d19-5732f1d351c6-1
00:04:55.624 --> 00:05:01.708
but really it's we were going to take on
a whole lot more functions in this space,

7ad7b2e3-0acc-4ff3-8d19-5732f1d351c6-2
00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:05.519
which is why it was training product
accreditation.

f071c767-70e6-4db7-99c7-b843f6fcd006-0
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.313
We've gone back to just doing our core
function,

f071c767-70e6-4db7-99c7-b843f6fcd006-1
00:05:09.313 --> 00:05:13.520
which is receiving applications to
accredit a new course.

d2752e7c-f405-4198-bdc2-ae439225ba5d-0
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.360
And so that really hasn't been changed
since Judy left.

d79a3194-f869-4d61-bf18-bdeec12208d8-0
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.148
We haven't done much to that solution
other than some minor tweaks around the

d79a3194-f869-4d61-bf18-bdeec12208d8-1
00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:23.440
edges.

4b9bdef1-7cee-4918-a641-8b09ad8e61f5-0
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.640
And that team is still sort of managing
nicely in this solution.

0273dd95-3d49-4e54-9076-f4321760ec4f-0
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.506
It's case management,
but it hasn't been uplifted to sort of be

0273dd95-3d49-4e54-9076-f4321760ec4f-1
00:05:34.506 --> 00:05:36.360
the universal case model.

56efa4dd-c3dc-4b56-bbce-563914392e00-0
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.186
And so at some point in the future,
I think they'll come back and say two

56efa4dd-c3dc-4b56-bbce-563914392e00-1
00:05:41.186 --> 00:05:46.208
things that we should uplift them to be
more in line with the universal case

56efa4dd-c3dc-4b56-bbce-563914392e00-2
00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:46.600
model.

00ea1075-013f-44d8-a768-dab5df0667c4-0
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.920
But we also didn't build all of their
application forms into a portal.

43252ea6-aea9-4c66-af86-ba67348888b5-0
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.640
So people can't apply to become a course
owner from a portal.

d274da8c-d440-46e8-b3cd-ebb9ddec516a-0
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.868
They still, you know, create a,
I think that might even be like a Gov CMS

d274da8c-d440-46e8-b3cd-ebb9ddec516a-1
00:05:59.868 --> 00:06:04.211
form that ends up sort of forwarding
across an email and that's got a whole

d274da8c-d440-46e8-b3cd-ebb9ddec516a-2
00:06:04.211 --> 00:06:06.039
lot of documents attached to it.

a74c136c-15bf-408f-b324-ba91f4afe76a-0
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.720
And so TBA is parked at the moment,
but maybe in the future they'll want to

a74c136c-15bf-408f-b324-ba91f4afe76a-1
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.800
digitise their forms and, you know,
have that as a portal function.

3be8363a-9846-438f-a796-3bf69ef49fcc-0
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.469
There has been talk though that Asqua may
not continue to have that training

3be8363a-9846-438f-a796-3bf69ef49fcc-1
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:24.280
product accreditation kind of function
anymore.

1533af92-3970-4bc4-9e75-5fe768283e8b-0
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.200
And so it'll go one of two ways.

78374bf5-efe1-495a-88e0-7ffae5ba67f1-0
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.981
They'll want us to extend their
functionality in the future or ask or

78374bf5-efe1-495a-88e0-7ffae5ba67f1-1
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:33.520
will just stop doing this function
altogether.

cbb197b7-0b24-4a20-ad1c-bea4abd3e130-0
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.363
So we,
we kind of don't have to worry about TPA

cbb197b7-0b24-4a20-ad1c-bea4abd3e130-1
00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:42.447
at the moment, OK,
Customer enquiry management,

cbb197b7-0b24-4a20-ad1c-bea4abd3e130-2
00:06:42.447 --> 00:06:45.680
originally that was the same solution.

dd803f27-da32-4b05-b3f2-0c8b8d923a61-0
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.160
It's got the Genesis components connected
to it.

87121c7e-320e-4cff-8b3e-4935ecf3db06-0
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:57.872
So that's our our IVR sort of call centre
solution that originally when DSD built

87121c7e-320e-4cff-8b3e-4935ecf3db06-1
00:06:57.872 --> 00:07:02.760
it was connected to the case record
directly.

86052675-abdd-4f78-a7d0-07fbeb1b8564-0
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.147
So as you know,
almost every phone call came in,

86052675-abdd-4f78-a7d0-07fbeb1b8564-1
00:07:06.147 --> 00:07:09.672
became a case,
any emails that they were receiving

86052675-abdd-4f78-a7d0-07fbeb1b8564-2
00:07:09.672 --> 00:07:10.640
became a case.

e86b7233-a6e2-4fe9-9783-c686fe3f2b04-0
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.800
But when we implemented the universal
case model,

e86b7233-a6e2-4fe9-9783-c686fe3f2b04-1
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.153
we said you guys don't really fit that
right because you're just someone called

e86b7233-a6e2-4fe9-9783-c686fe3f2b04-2
00:07:18.153 --> 00:07:19.840
up and you just sent them APDF.

1e890b63-af73-4608-b47a-0ae05ec08549-0
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.360
That's not a case, right?

aa76c9fc-6323-446e-b876-97ecc1374344-0
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.681
And so we did a bunch of work to
replicate their case functionality into

aa76c9fc-6323-446e-b876-97ecc1374344-1
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.240
an enquiry record.

9d6b77e7-c6f3-41fe-87bd-b815560433d8-0
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.160
And so Genesis is kind of connected to
that.

e9aa83e7-3db8-4e86-b2a9-7bdfbb69b490-0
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.262
It now creates a phone activity and the
phone activity converts to an enquiry

e9aa83e7-3db8-4e86-b2a9-7bdfbb69b490-1
00:07:38.262 --> 00:07:38.720
record.

de2d73f0-158e-4568-8b91-a59030db83ef-0
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.760
And so the solution is good because it's
sort of hived off to the side now.

21dc0c0f-5ddb-45ba-9415-20ccd1ad97a8-0
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.757
It's not using case,
but we're still got some residual

21dc0c0f-5ddb-45ba-9415-20ccd1ad97a8-1
00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:50.520
functions using that Sams case module.

1eca686e-36d9-4d70-83a4-639f98eebb9d-0
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.097
And so we're trying to push people out of
that so that the only thing we end up in

1eca686e-36d9-4d70-83a4-639f98eebb9d-1
00:07:56.097 --> 00:08:00.600
the case table is really those regulatory
UCM type cases in there.

3aa6dd20-0aab-4a76-88c2-47ee549cf629-0
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.480
But largely Sims is now off to the side
as well, right?

89f57f5d-d6f1-493b-b079-dfda45aff20b-0
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.160
They're not 100% happy with that solution.

45e11b9a-d637-486b-8e6d-07376b828176-0
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.360
But for, for mine,
it's actually working OK for them for now.

d39ae61a-2e3e-4e69-981e-af7a745bf3d5-0
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.883
We might get some more enhancements in
that space,

d39ae61a-2e3e-4e69-981e-af7a745bf3d5-1
00:08:16.883 --> 00:08:20.200
but they're largely out of case
management now.

b772d5c2-3b40-4229-9c7a-747706cd5c6b-0
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.763
They're really just using their own
Genesis connected to to phone activities

b772d5c2-3b40-4229-9c7a-747706cd5c6b-1
00:08:25.763 --> 00:08:29.320
and then creating inquiry records off to
the side there.

fabe095f-9daa-4aa9-8baf-779390a8e19c-0
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.478
Since then,
I think intelligence was the next app

fabe095f-9daa-4aa9-8baf-779390a8e19c-1
00:08:36.478 --> 00:08:37.720
that came along.

5f2f47f0-b002-4bd9-bc2d-c398f40a3e42-0
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.560
Again,
that was the first big app for Raj Radha.

ed7040fb-98ae-4902-bf30-8feb200e64a0-0
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.480
They obviously did all the transition of
of the sends one out of cases as well.

ef4afb12-ec17-40f2-b8d7-b4f7c3093b4d-0
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.721
Did all the foundational case build,
but then they sort of went into the

ef4afb12-ec17-40f2-b8d7-b4f7c3093b4d-1
00:08:51.721 --> 00:08:57.393
intelligence as a function and that
started with replacement of Asqua Connect,

ef4afb12-ec17-40f2-b8d7-b4f7c3093b4d-2
00:08:57.393 --> 00:09:00.840
which was our legacy kind of complaints
portal.

39a39091-73b5-4ba3-8806-e56a8cfd7c96-0
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.280
So Asqua Connect's been decommissioned.

f062304e-ecca-447d-91e3-c8b148667f06-0
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.442
We're now on the on the arms portal and,
and,

f062304e-ecca-447d-91e3-c8b148667f06-1
00:09:08.442 --> 00:09:14.596
and people generally are referring to
that as the the Asqua portal,

f062304e-ecca-447d-91e3-c8b148667f06-2
00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.040
the next generation portal.

5306a92e-49d7-4424-bb40-3a5cca2e1bc3-0
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.080
It's just Asqua portal.asqua.
gov dot AU right?

8077d346-7e2b-4677-b142-b25ca6e7b2fd-0
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.240
So very generic.

d2beb96d-bd9d-4810-8fde-66169358e597-0
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.600
It's not like where we had the Asquinet
branding and all of those things.

cfea0eb8-1075-4cd7-a63e-9a82e8963e41-0
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.400
We're totally got away from Asquinet.

82940502-cc94-4099-9246-b332237aca7e-0
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.840
It's just the Asqua portal now.

6c219d9f-8c2c-4fa2-ad99-f2b27775220e-0
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.081
We first went live with an
unauthenticated solution on that portal,

6c219d9f-8c2c-4fa2-ad99-f2b27775220e-1
00:09:35.081 --> 00:09:40.175
which was for our tip off form,
which was a replacement of the complaints

6c219d9f-8c2c-4fa2-ad99-f2b27775220e-2
00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:40.520
form.

2f37637b-db60-4604-aafe-bc25616c4b48-0
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.520
The tip off form's not that complicated.

829ed20e-9fbe-4eb2-a5bd-e84b73f0532d-0
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.440
Our old complaint form had like 80
questions on it.

b085899c-da4e-4cbb-8754-08d881303777-0
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.680
This new one's got like 10 questions on
it.

5957b498-8c24-45ec-b7e1-54f76641f947-0
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.640
So they're really simplified down.

26f0eb93-ca02-4671-8ed1-5bb088314e15-0
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.274
It's kinda tell us a little bit about who
you are if you want to,

26f0eb93-ca02-4671-8ed1-5bb088314e15-1
00:09:55.274 --> 00:09:59.680
and then tell us about the organisation,
the people involved and what happened.

c16bcb8a-7852-4b1e-bc57-a033dfbb304c-0
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.840
And so it's a very sort of generic tip
off form that was the first iteration.

a21a03b7-ab31-4a13-b196-98b66da6cfeb-0
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.020
And what was happening when those would
come in and it would create cases in

a21a03b7-ab31-4a13-b196-98b66da6cfeb-1
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.680
Aspinet and they'd manage all of the work
there.

4cb24d82-3d74-428f-9bd8-66842a5eab88-0
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.000
And then we went through and build out
their full case management function.

4d747e51-ba0f-42ec-96b7-be9b2adeae02-0
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.431
So they now have an entire end to end tip
off comes in,

4d747e51-ba0f-42ec-96b7-be9b2adeae02-1
00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:24.280
creates a tip off submission record.

b4ee972d-f9e5-4fd7-869d-867864bae8ea-0
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.520
They do some triage sort of work in that
that submission record.

ef5e4143-fd7f-4c68-9cdc-4f06a47d7ecb-0
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.080
And this is a real model for us moving
forward, right?

b4ce0588-0c44-4e92-82ee-9491c2e40785-0
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.565
Everything coming from the portal,
every single change,

b4ce0588-0c44-4e92-82ee-9491c2e40785-1
00:10:36.565 --> 00:10:41.296
even if it's not an official form,
even if you're just going in and editing

b4ce0588-0c44-4e92-82ee-9491c2e40785-2
00:10:41.296 --> 00:10:44.159
some details,
it kind of is going to create a

b4ce0588-0c44-4e92-82ee-9491c2e40785-3
00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:45.280
submission record.

7f05ae9c-4ddf-402d-a14f-1ec48328594f-0
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.160
And each of the submission records is,
is its own individual thing, right?

a8062b2e-d3dd-497a-99ee-170a5564ab4b-0
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.240
So,
so we haven't tried to bundle a bunch of

a8062b2e-d3dd-497a-99ee-170a5564ab4b-1
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.280
different types of submissions into one
submission record.

f3ce1b0f-1bd9-43f5-bd3a-4e547f55d88e-0
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.178
The the model is kind of each new and
then that's in line with power pages and

f3ce1b0f-1bd9-43f5-bd3a-4e547f55d88e-1
00:11:02.178 --> 00:11:04.080
the way it works with D365, right.

b53de226-4ac6-4c54-9002-b5a8af040b42-0
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.331
It's like when you when you create a form,
it creates kind of its own record in its

b53de226-4ac6-4c54-9002-b5a8af040b42-1
00:11:08.331 --> 00:11:09.040
own container.

3ca4ae3b-98ab-4637-9341-071441157e51-0
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.200
And so that's our submission records.

8575331a-7a26-4002-9c0e-66732616ac74-0
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.000
And so we have a tip off submission.

e650d897-558d-4e11-a76b-cd46c47ac704-0
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.440
We now have AQI submission and I'll get
to qualification integrity in a second.

3a87cf3c-9189-41ff-84a1-a7e2c74e5481-0
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.691
And and what the team's working on in RMA
now are a bunch of different submission

3a87cf3c-9189-41ff-84a1-a7e2c74e5481-1
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:28.200
records.

8c31acbb-0616-47c2-995a-390c114b63d9-0
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.080
If you're adding a new person,
it'll be a submission record.

40674ebe-c593-488e-8576-ebea445474c0-0
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.960
If you're adding a new training product,
it'll be a new submission record.

e95ac1a8-e576-4199-97d7-a22c912eeb81-0
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.000
And then the same thing sort of happens,
right?

348f679a-7040-4051-99f4-3b4da082cfb7-0
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.080
They do a little bit of assessment slash
triage on the actual submission records

348f679a-7040-4051-99f4-3b4da082cfb7-1
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.840
and then they'll create where they need
to,

348f679a-7040-4051-99f4-3b4da082cfb7-2
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.600
they'll create cases to do more
processing.

9f2ea3e3-580f-4dde-b1c9-9bb05dcb1900-0
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.483
But some things,
there'll be two things in the RMA

9f2ea3e3-580f-4dde-b1c9-9bb05dcb1900-1
00:11:52.483 --> 00:11:56.816
submission records,
a bunch of them will kind of auto process

9f2ea3e3-580f-4dde-b1c9-9bb05dcb1900-2
00:11:56.816 --> 00:12:00.240
because it's just updating really minor
details.

5c84e480-03a1-415a-89f5-eeb6777998b4-0
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.888
You know,
you changed a contact person for one of

5c84e480-03a1-415a-89f5-eeb6777998b4-1
00:12:03.888 --> 00:12:05.640
your delivery locations.

ad602b38-58e9-4770-a0a4-c54918df4d62-0
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.240
We don't need to approve that, right?

c0b4a269-c2fb-4683-93ec-3fe06d4a89d7-0
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.120
It's just an update of information.

8c251b75-43db-4f46-a7a0-8fbbbd2477d4-0
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.640
We still have a submission record for it.

0bcd11fe-0573-452e-89f1-183559b576f9-0
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.800
So we know who did it, when they did it,
how it was actioned.

52555de7-c9a9-40b0-b1fe-9b632877f4ef-0
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.240
But the system kind of will process that
automatically.

e924a56d-1021-4d0e-b0cb-60457bb7268e-0
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.676
There's some other submission records
that they'll take a look at and

e924a56d-1021-4d0e-b0cb-60457bb7268e-1
00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:29.040
potentially do something maybe before
they say we're OK with that action it.

add12958-2929-44cc-83d9-ac9b9cbee209-0
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.157
And so the the entire workflow is still
kind of in that submission record,

add12958-2929-44cc-83d9-ac9b9cbee209-1
00:12:34.157 --> 00:12:35.640
but it's very, very basic.

57f3addb-cad9-4e46-8978-364900b10189-0
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.160
It's just to have a look at it.

7960e0bd-b954-4b44-8b07-93dd02d64f54-0
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.520
Does it all look OK?

f19fd5ff-5dc9-4c46-a00b-2d11c968577d-0
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.120
Just say proceed and it will go and apply
changes.

8770404b-d4e4-4b20-9e4a-74f5f7b9211f-0
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.600
The third submissions are ones like the
adding products to scope.

2fa16d06-6abe-45c3-8575-4bb1972343d7-0
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.985
We'll do a case and we'll do an
assessment against, you know,

2fa16d06-6abe-45c3-8575-4bb1972343d7-1
00:12:50.985 --> 00:12:55.196
other training products that you've got,
whether there's any complaints about you,

2fa16d06-6abe-45c3-8575-4bb1972343d7-2
00:12:55.196 --> 00:12:58.544
all those sorts of things,
and then decide whether we're going to

2fa16d06-6abe-45c3-8575-4bb1972343d7-3
00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:00.320
approve or reject that application.

05845083-2639-4c01-a356-00743da0896e-0
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.480
So it's almost like 3 three ways
submission records get closed, right?

36d7ae12-5402-4dd5-a44b-bc802d26bfb4-0
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.680
The first one's automatically.

3f9d4147-3e70-4d01-b927-8a61a8f2999c-0
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.080
The second one is we have a look at it
and close it in the submission record.

6b00892c-1e6d-4cd1-a5a2-acd5b84de81b-0
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.377
The third one is it kind of goes through
a case and then the end result is that

6b00892c-1e6d-4cd1-a5a2-acd5b84de81b-1
00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.000
the submission will get updated.

a2e107bd-3ae9-4d9c-b58a-56352e9477ca-0
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.640
Yep, that makes sense.

d14ae5a1-5e96-42b4-89ba-0aabc4ac70f9-0
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.560
Yes, yes.

93e620dd-5c72-4b77-820f-ab7e948fb4fc-0
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.600
All right, cool.

e4af86bf-4108-499d-a04d-b0be36a89cd5-0
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.680
I was gonna go somewhere that was higher.

684f742a-c966-44db-9544-7ec85cf390b8-0
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.200
Ah, cool.

52288ad1-32b7-4cba-956e-723c60432821-0
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:32.442
And so when when we talk about Palmy,
which is the word Pradeep and I and you

52288ad1-32b7-4cba-956e-723c60432821-1
00:13:32.442 --> 00:13:34.720
will be doing a a bit of this.

7a1af6dd-a734-429e-8dc8-51e5f556bcc4-0
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.320
This is the integration piece.

6e03a0fc-6d07-4b84-96fe-f02c9656eceb-0
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.760
All works off Palmy.

94148bb1-e90d-453e-9cd2-4f382440ce82-0
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:45.280
Palmy is the provider and registration
management and integration module, right.

3754fb9d-2cb8-4d67-ae85-93466e52e91e-0
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:53.320
And so let me flick something up here
which I can share all this stuff with you.

d2be92d6-b96f-4a15-80c8-85c02f343085-0
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.520
I think I've got,
let's just look at this one.

f2c3155a-32aa-41d6-9e7a-95c4026c0cd5-0
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.400
It might be in here.

e13fd828-7500-4210-be0e-e4c97593a850-0
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.680
No, it's not.

f6ecc8bb-fa29-478d-9993-33d11a085a53-0
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.080
Let me just open.

f4463fd8-7103-4560-a1fb-58973ea875e5-0
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.320
I'll show you this one as well.

74f0ed2c-b7ab-449a-8292-dfedbd82aced-0
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.680
But there's another one here,
push and pull model.

262ccf5d-9e0c-4563-b63a-4407d8936017-0
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.280
So this one,
what this one's talking about, right?

07030931-10a8-476b-b5c0-ef94f843b88b-0
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.200
So let me,
let me just quickly talk through this one.

4bc25e9a-cd8a-41bc-be9a-77b6c19cdd5c-0
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.480
So what I was saying to people,
this is about the source of truth.

ebd968af-04e5-40a7-a675-bf529068330d-0
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.433
And so on the left hand side,
we've got Aspinet,

ebd968af-04e5-40a7-a675-bf529068330d-1
00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:27.600
on the right hand side we've got arms.

804b22e6-63f7-4ce3-a048-2a16e6986b53-0
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.883
And So what I was talking to Executive
and Chain and others about was at the

804b22e6-63f7-4ce3-a048-2a16e6986b53-1
00:14:32.883 --> 00:14:36.197
moment,
like when we go live with an RMA function,

804b22e6-63f7-4ce3-a048-2a16e6986b53-2
00:14:36.197 --> 00:14:41.655
if we're going to be running both systems
and Ascuanet is still the source of truth

804b22e6-63f7-4ce3-a048-2a16e6986b53-3
00:14:41.655 --> 00:14:43.800
and it's still publishing to TGA.

55852424-60bf-454d-a465-3725d559b197-0
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.822
Then when we,
when we build a new function,

55852424-60bf-454d-a465-3725d559b197-1
00:14:46.822 --> 00:14:51.636
we kind of have to spend money over here
to build the new function and we sort of

55852424-60bf-454d-a465-3725d559b197-2
00:14:51.636 --> 00:14:56.391
have to spend money here to deprecate the
new function that we've delivered from

55852424-60bf-454d-a465-3725d559b197-3
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:56.920
Asquinet.

8a977edd-e085-4ce5-a76a-053cd2b37d16-0
00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.260
But we also now that this new function
lives over here,

8a977edd-e085-4ce5-a76a-053cd2b37d16-1
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.578
we have to push all the data back to
Asquinet so that it can get published to

8a977edd-e085-4ce5-a76a-053cd2b37d16-2
00:15:04.578 --> 00:15:04.800
TGA.

587424df-f1b8-4a1b-9fdb-91d7f2f7b489-0
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.088
And, and as we're building new staff,
what we're really doing is moving closer

587424df-f1b8-4a1b-9fdb-91d7f2f7b489-1
00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:14.520
towards Arms being the source of truth,
right?

02c018dd-af82-48ba-884c-d66fffc05fcb-0
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.248
And so you'll see we've now got ad scope
and Reg updates and contact updates,

02c018dd-af82-48ba-884c-d66fffc05fcb-1
00:15:19.248 --> 00:15:23.826
which means we're still pushing all this
information back to Asquinet so that it

02c018dd-af82-48ba-884c-d66fffc05fcb-2
00:15:23.826 --> 00:15:25.240
can get published to TGA.

c190e664-da25-49e0-aae5-e3440f41371c-0
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.847
But what would make more sense is at some
point Arms becomes the source of truth,

c190e664-da25-49e0-aae5-e3440f41371c-1
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:31.240
right?

1cb8f5f1-869c-4cf8-85d0-8a17ced1d73d-0
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.240
And then registration management has
moved all the way across to.

1a71a9a5-03b3-42be-85bb-7613c5a46589-0
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.275
And so registration management is palmy,
right,

1a71a9a5-03b3-42be-85bb-7613c5a46589-1
00:15:38.275 --> 00:15:41.880
because it's the curated data set that
publishes to TGA.

027b7015-6157-4e68-8317-adf457a91a8f-0
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:48.040
And so I said the really critical thing
is we need to do this as soon as possible.

dd7803c1-59af-4ec7-bd03-555e417e3bcb-0
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.661
Otherwise you're spending all this money
building stuff to push data back to

dd7803c1-59af-4ec7-bd03-555e417e3bcb-1
00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:55.360
Aspenet and it's all throw away effort,
right?

09671e28-58a1-4c2e-934c-9e2507f7aaae-0
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:55.840
Yeah.

baa34315-6bdf-4c43-bd1b-739eb468a196-0
00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.040
And so,
so they kind of repositioned here to go.

c99555db-3315-49d9-b388-d912ecef7e4b-0
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.160
Let's stop rapidly deploying to
production little incremental solutions.

3ec03c83-10a2-4cda-9098-d1d0599d982e-0
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:13.016
Now we need to have a longer delivery
window so that we can do all of this

3ec03c83-10a2-4cda-9098-d1d0599d982e-1
00:16:13.016 --> 00:16:14.880
shifting work, right.

e7613362-d9eb-46e0-af6b-70d1a869320f-0
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.213
And this is,
this is the Palmi work and this is the

e7613362-d9eb-46e0-af6b-70d1a869320f-1
00:16:18.213 --> 00:16:19.560
TGA integration work.

cb393ab5-709a-4d19-977d-272324f101b5-0
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:25.237
This is moving all of registration
management across to arms and it's also

cb393ab5-709a-4d19-977d-272324f101b5-1
00:16:25.237 --> 00:16:30.602
moving the way we publish to TGA to,
to come out of the arms registration

cb393ab5-709a-4d19-977d-272324f101b5-2
00:16:30.602 --> 00:16:31.400
management.

250ff770-787a-41cc-be86-432ef120a405-0
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.405
And the biggest thing there is,
there will still be some processes in

250ff770-787a-41cc-be86-432ef120a405-1
00:16:35.405 --> 00:16:35.920
Asquinet.

f2c824e6-2fcc-4bc1-8068-f665f0ea1887-0
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.615
And so where we do need that data to be
published,

f2c824e6-2fcc-4bc1-8068-f665f0ea1887-1
00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:42.040
we'll just push that data across to arms.

5ed193e6-3516-44dc-8fca-5e3ed52c98e6-0
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.760
And so it sort of flips that arrow there,
right?

d8696f7b-42d8-43db-9ce8-88b164fedc27-0
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.813
Pretty obvious sort of stuff where it's
just like we used to be pushing

d8696f7b-42d8-43db-9ce8-88b164fedc27-1
00:16:47.813 --> 00:16:48.640
everything this way.

47e911d5-7a99-4a83-b7ff-320ac0a501f7-0
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.290
We have to start just everything lives
now in arms and it's only the legacy

47e911d5-7a99-4a83-b7ff-320ac0a501f7-1
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.600
stuff that's still left in Aspinet that
we push across.

bb421f9d-c24d-4254-af3a-058af21ff23b-0
00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.160
OK, got it.

60ba7949-be0e-4611-b070-596d5398e5d3-0
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.253
They so they got all of this and they're
like, all right, let's slow down,

60ba7949-be0e-4611-b070-596d5398e5d3-1
00:17:04.253 --> 00:17:07.680
let's do the RMA project,
let's do a longer delivery window.

e58ee2de-4cc7-46d1-bde5-edcd59fa0daf-0
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.026
So,
so we're talking they're thinking mid

e58ee2de-4cc7-46d1-bde5-edcd59fa0daf-1
00:17:11.026 --> 00:17:13.320
year, I'm thinking end of year.

3bbc8f69-ea7d-4099-84c7-ee33d0663fb9-0
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.991
So,
so December next year in 12 months time

3bbc8f69-ea7d-4099-84c7-ee33d0663fb9-1
00:17:15.991 --> 00:17:20.910
is probably by the time we've moved all
of that registration management stuff to

3bbc8f69-ea7d-4099-84c7-ee33d0663fb9-2
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.643
arms,
built all of the new portal functions,

3bbc8f69-ea7d-4099-84c7-ee33d0663fb9-3
00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:27.043
got all of our authentication and
authorization models,

3bbc8f69-ea7d-4099-84c7-ee33d0663fb9-4
00:17:27.043 --> 00:17:31.476
rebuilt our integration services to be
able to publish to T I think it's

3bbc8f69-ea7d-4099-84c7-ee33d0663fb9-5
00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:35.120
probably closer to 12 months before we're
ready to go live.

9cbefadc-b482-4c57-85b5-d0b62437fed5-0
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.666
But what they wanna do is keep pushing
into pre prod the whole way through as

9cbefadc-b482-4c57-85b5-d0b62437fed5-1
00:17:39.666 --> 00:17:44.043
we're building new functions and getting
the business to test and demonstrating

9cbefadc-b482-4c57-85b5-d0b62437fed5-2
00:17:44.043 --> 00:17:45.520
our progress from pre prod.

0b99edbd-7444-48a6-80c2-02f124998c78-0
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.480
And that's kind of our definition of done
right is pre prod.

ebcb9e07-48e0-41a7-8c4a-517fe8935294-0
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.908
And then at the end we'll do a bigger
bang release to production, which is,

ebcb9e07-48e0-41a7-8c4a-517fe8935294-1
00:17:53.908 --> 00:17:56.795
you know,
migrating all of our users into the new

ebcb9e07-48e0-41a7-8c4a-517fe8935294-2
00:17:56.795 --> 00:17:57.199
portal.

f45d769e-169b-477b-a401-be4255933fd9-0
00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.522
Most of the functions are available on
the new Asqua portal,

f45d769e-169b-477b-a401-be4255933fd9-1
00:18:01.522 --> 00:18:06.809
but there might still be a couple of
residual functions and the way I'm trying

f45d769e-169b-477b-a401-be4255933fd9-2
00:18:06.809 --> 00:18:11.160
to split that is the really low volume,
low low usage functions.

a564933f-f03f-4f86-af1a-29b05c6dbf88-0
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.433
Leave them on Askwinet if we don't have
time,

a564933f-f03f-4f86-af1a-29b05c6dbf88-1
00:18:14.433 --> 00:18:19.120
but 80% of the functionality will be in
our new portal when we migrate.

4eedbd9d-d4cc-4711-a53e-8c362aa3987a-0
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.560
Got it.

93b93141-6cab-4220-9587-a95c3cc02076-0
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:20.680
Yeah.

727c8efb-0177-4527-a322-f6b96050064a-0
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.536
So,
so probably sometime between June and

727c8efb-0177-4527-a322-f6b96050064a-1
00:18:23.536 --> 00:18:27.760
December, yet to be agreed,
we'll do a bigger bang deployment.

fa43b490-0fb8-4c05-a508-4128f408746d-0
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.162
And that is basically this thing
happening right where we sort of switch

fa43b490-0fb8-4c05-a508-4128f408746d-1
00:18:32.162 --> 00:18:34.760
over to arms being the source of truth
there.

ac13165f-fa97-4239-91d8-409b957d3afc-0
00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:36.160
OK.

95caabb5-9212-4805-8438-f4845a9ae6d2-0
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.240
And so actually, let me just look here.

33fdaa23-75e7-4b4d-88f3-6ee43648c569-0
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.160
Pandas press 2.

5d24ccfc-3c95-40f2-9276-af9ec448cdf2-0
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:49.960
Let's just go DI think it was the D com
strategy.

0661f916-8fa7-4a92-9799-b1c784d72c73-0
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.680
So it it this was a second presentation I
did because the message wasn't getting in.

a886db1d-d296-4c77-8c69-a7a6a3c66ff0-0
00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.935
And so the first presentation was sort of
talking about the fact that there's a

a886db1d-d296-4c77-8c69-a7a6a3c66ff0-1
00:19:00.935 --> 00:19:05.920
bunch of words in here about maximising
benefits and blah, blah, blah.

8637a3f3-83a2-4759-b87e-850652c61a34-0
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.640
But really it showed a similar thing,
but a slightly different detail.

68b0cf45-f251-43d1-aa60-0c9f864cf00a-0
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:16.095
And the reason that this is important is
if you look at can you,

68b0cf45-f251-43d1-aa60-0c9f864cf00a-1
00:19:16.095 --> 00:19:17.800
can you see that enough?

8d6c50b1-b2c3-42fd-bfa3-0d9055108011-0
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can.

24a1bd45-eedb-4fea-bb02-34df1b4134a8-0
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.330
So,
So you'll see what I sort of said is it's

24a1bd45-eedb-4fea-bb02-34df1b4134a8-1
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:28.638
almost like there's a line across the
below that first set of of orange boxes

24a1bd45-eedb-4fea-bb02-34df1b4134a8-2
00:19:28.638 --> 00:19:30.000
there or pink boxes.

db344b2c-6383-474c-9ea1-f10a75cc85c0-0
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.800
And above that line is Parmy.

fb63af3c-7c0a-4572-984d-66ff9ba850e4-0
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.080
It is that curated data set.

74cdea2a-4cf7-4622-8184-8c277e55e02d-0
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.040
It is the data set that publishes to TGA.

1e49b988-9b38-443f-ab94-823d087b9fba-0
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.616
So it's all about organisations,
their registrations,

1e49b988-9b38-443f-ab94-823d087b9fba-1
00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:47.450
the training products, their,
their delivery locations, who their their,

1e49b988-9b38-443f-ab94-823d087b9fba-2
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.960
you know,
governing people and primary contacts are.

24239e71-e9be-4f40-b09d-82c08e3089c5-0
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.720
And so that's the data that we published
to TGA.

b8690f23-688b-4ee5-b384-0f0d0675a354-0
00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.000
Everything below that is kind of the work
that Aspen does, right?

ea3c5b5d-c1eb-40d1-a92b-b09d4b258690-0
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.138
So we receive applications and we receive
changes to people's registrations and we

ea3c5b5d-c1eb-40d1-a92b-b09d4b258690-1
00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:07.840
used to get complaints.

4e2d1b15-f992-43bc-971d-a1d2a4b718b2-0
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.080
We now get tip offs.

4faeef5a-4974-4836-8033-48ebe1ab0857-0
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.466
We request information,
we refer stuff to other teams,

4faeef5a-4974-4836-8033-48ebe1ab0857-1
00:20:13.466 --> 00:20:16.080
they do audits, we make decisions.

2bc637d0-ca8b-414f-8759-fc0e664465bf-0
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.560
We can reconsider our decisions, right?

57ed490a-279b-4eb6-954d-9d50fd06fc6c-0
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.000
All of that stuff for me is the work that
Asqua does.

d6a956e5-6471-4d2c-8de2-df357db2c18e-0
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.800
And if you look at Arms.

5dceef39-ebad-4b01-8438-7d8fd95a2ccf-0
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.000
That's the work that the RMA,
the Honey bees team are doing, right?

c45f491d-1550-4a85-a244-9b57fd366c9e-0
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.760
They, they,
they started with tip offs and complaints.

2e738a2a-c72c-4455-b57d-fdb8f1850c8d-0
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.440
They've done some service delivery stuff.

ed1fbef1-4b40-4d21-a7bf-85b252ea71e6-0
00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:38.360
They're they're in the registration
applications and change notifications.

7d1bb1d6-3469-40a3-82b9-f7b635f11f43-0
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:44.230
But everything that's down below this
line here, every, everything that's here,

7d1bb1d6-3469-40a3-82b9-f7b635f11f43-1
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:49.533
when that gets processed and completed,
it ends up in a change to this stuff

7d1bb1d6-3469-40a3-82b9-f7b635f11f43-2
00:20:49.533 --> 00:20:51.600
that's sort of above the line.

9f9b530d-f833-4b64-affa-e794753be358-0
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

a22c4cdd-0da5-4e95-8802-549a14a2d3b5-0
00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.549
And so,
so this is how I was describing to people

a22c4cdd-0da5-4e95-8802-549a14a2d3b5-1
00:20:57.549 --> 00:21:01.440
that that stuff that's above the line is
the Palmy data set.

f9497e5d-1631-427d-8534-79ddc750ff0e-0
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.200
It's a curated data set.

206bc647-7c61-4afe-a5cd-8c79e53b989f-0
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.207
And that's the stuff that Pradeep myself
and you are going to sort of build out

206bc647-7c61-4afe-a5cd-8c79e53b989f-1
00:21:08.207 --> 00:21:13.014
how we're going to deal with addresses,
how what is ABN going to be a mandatory

206bc647-7c61-4afe-a5cd-8c79e53b989f-2
00:21:13.014 --> 00:21:16.800
field in organisation so that we get much
better cleaner data.

19db364e-3d2c-4cc3-a502-db8bc817e068-0
00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.320
How do we want to deal with registration
statuses?

96ee6597-d480-4513-b9cd-cde8026b191d-0
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:26.120
All of the building of the new provider
curated data set is our responsibility.

fb4094ae-8b73-4d4a-abdc-0fc7ab1ba154-0
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.560
Everything that's below the line is kind
of honey bees.

63c7dd80-c593-4300-b992-31518f32e6b1-0
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.800
PS responsibility,
all of the work that Asqua does.

17524220-ce2c-4c1f-8a0e-4ee730d6c66d-0
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:38.439
And so we're kind of at this critical
point now because you can hear Raj and

17524220-ce2c-4c1f-8a0e-4ee730d6c66d-1
00:21:38.439 --> 00:21:43.360
Radha talking about building the delivery
location module for the portal.

fa084ad7-835b-40b0-bd86-adaf0382251e-0
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.108
Well,
we haven't really defined the underlying

fa084ad7-835b-40b0-bd86-adaf0382251e-1
00:21:47.108 --> 00:21:48.360
address model yet.

aa9b0c2d-7f6f-4b1d-b950-de4bccf5c660-0
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.927
And,
and there's a lot of complexity because

aa9b0c2d-7f6f-4b1d-b950-de4bccf5c660-1
00:21:51.927 --> 00:21:55.920
these addresses or locations get mapped
to scope items.

bce09766-9c77-4c4b-bb51-1b7776074673-0
00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.341
And, and if you're a large provider,
you might have 100 delivery locations and

bce09766-9c77-4c4b-bb51-1b7776074673-1
00:22:01.341 --> 00:22:02.440
500 scope items.

6f7739a0-2ac3-463c-922d-d65c83db737e-0
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.348
And so the mapping of all of that
information as well as how many students

6f7739a0-2ac3-463c-922d-d65c83db737e-1
00:22:07.348 --> 00:22:09.200
can you have at this location?

8e8ec431-e0dd-4eff-894e-5c796c3b9793-0
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.960
You know,
what's the address of this location?

5b3454ec-7ba6-4efd-b773-d0c04f830e10-0
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.200
Do you own it?

223f716d-a9c6-4d1e-9672-2d9702aafa5c-0
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.686
Do you at least there's,
there's all of this information about the

223f716d-a9c6-4d1e-9672-2d9702aafa5c-1
00:22:17.686 --> 00:22:22.976
locations and so we need to do some work
down in this Palmy area to define the

223f716d-a9c6-4d1e-9672-2d9702aafa5c-2
00:22:22.976 --> 00:22:28.200
home for the data while they're also
doing work at the same time on building.

3302a728-e732-4e7c-b507-0c015276cbba-0
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.520
How do I add a delivery location?

93d3f8c3-8d38-455a-aeac-a66fe6a3c3db-0
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.817
And so it's really important now that we
start sort of working hand in glove

93d3f8c3-8d38-455a-aeac-a66fe6a3c3db-1
00:22:35.817 --> 00:22:39.890
because everything they're starting to
build, it's got to update this,

93d3f8c3-8d38-455a-aeac-a66fe6a3c3db-2
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.440
this Palmy data set, right?

32862c56-25f3-46ea-8c1a-534b65f8f54e-0
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.006
So,
so we got to get very close on what our

32862c56-25f3-46ea-8c1a-534b65f8f54e-1
00:22:44.006 --> 00:22:45.640
models for some of this are.

ec7dd222-67a0-4e61-8761-1996230af368-0
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:53.408
The way we build Palmy directly relates
to how you will build this TGA

ec7dd222-67a0-4e61-8761-1996230af368-1
00:22:53.408 --> 00:22:54.920
integration, right?

c1eb1b15-ec06-4738-9b0a-6e9211e5186b-0
00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.067
TGA is not really changing,
but our data model that sits underneath

c1eb1b15-ec06-4738-9b0a-6e9211e5186b-1
00:23:00.067 --> 00:23:03.640
it is going to change when we define the
new Palmy world.

89f5ac72-df98-4c0a-9dab-ff7db5beb6ae-0
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.880
But it has to be constrained by how we
have to publish that data to TGA.

40783411-be57-4170-b430-495e7e5c88d4-0
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:14.196
So we can't just make some wild change
right now to the way Palmy is going to

40783411-be57-4170-b430-495e7e5c88d4-1
00:23:14.196 --> 00:23:17.400
work because it's got to still publish to
TGA.

1bb4e1e8-780f-4e50-9507-99972ce22715-0
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.219
So we'll we'll still have orgs,
we'll still have registrations,

1bb4e1e8-780f-4e50-9507-99972ce22715-1
00:23:20.219 --> 00:23:22.774
we'll still have scope items,
we'll still have locations,

1bb4e1e8-780f-4e50-9507-99972ce22715-2
00:23:22.774 --> 00:23:23.920
we'll still have contacts.

92ec9e4d-c5fb-4f5a-838c-3a08e9afdddb-0
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.229
But we want to get rid of that legacy
tech debt that we've got on the Asquinet

92ec9e4d-c5fb-4f5a-838c-3a08e9afdddb-1
00:23:28.229 --> 00:23:29.280
side for that stuff.

1b79bbeb-17bf-4fd5-88bf-cbcb75f558ff-0
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.081
And so, yeah, it's,
it's kind of strategic changes that we're

1b79bbeb-17bf-4fd5-88bf-cbcb75f558ff-1
00:23:33.081 --> 00:23:35.840
going to be making,
but we can't go too far.

72b4aa83-25b1-410f-bc92-5260c1df6256-0
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:42.151
I don't think TGA yet has budget to build
new web services or make significant

72b4aa83-25b1-410f-bc92-5260c1df6256-1
00:23:42.151 --> 00:23:44.240
changes to their front end.

fd3215a0-aa1c-4a9f-adf7-32c69284404b-0
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.394
And so we can't come along and go, oh,
we're radically changing the way we're

fd3215a0-aa1c-4a9f-adf7-32c69284404b-1
00:23:48.394 --> 00:23:52.549
doing delivery locations because they
won't have the budget to accommodate us

fd3215a0-aa1c-4a9f-adf7-32c69284404b-2
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:54.520
pushing different or new information.

0b6de041-500e-42dd-9658-6b4a9a418808-0
00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.000
So, but we do have a longer term strategy.

765ea4e5-f30f-451f-ac40-d62934ccf983-0
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.320
They are going to go to REST APIs.

b8b2a2b0-c95b-49c7-8fb0-d0fa31aa2a1c-0
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.000
They're they will get a budget.

de3ad171-b851-4e71-b560-a0a80344292f-0
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.840
There will be an opportunity for us to,
we will have built our new model and kind

de3ad171-b851-4e71-b560-a0a80344292f-1
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.320
of mapped it back to their existing model.

33144c15-e5ac-4f4f-b934-db9c9ce88487-0
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.084
But there'll be an opportunity in the
future for us to go now we want TGA

33144c15-e5ac-4f4f-b934-db9c9ce88487-1
00:24:14.084 --> 00:24:17.240
updated to display this information
differently.

4a27ccc6-4d4e-4574-af29-28a8dfd53b1f-0
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.563
We,
your TGA is going to build new web

4a27ccc6-4d4e-4574-af29-28a8dfd53b1f-1
00:24:19.563 --> 00:24:22.720
services and,
and all those different things, right?

cac1c9b7-4afb-4759-a080-de3aab9caf16-0
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.434
So,
so that's that's a very much a future

cac1c9b7-4afb-4759-a080-de3aab9caf16-1
00:24:25.434 --> 00:24:30.217
piece of were were sort of hamstrung a
little bit to build to their their

cac1c9b7-4afb-4759-a080-de3aab9caf16-2
00:24:30.217 --> 00:24:32.480
existing legacy SOAP APIs, I guess.

79021ab9-918e-496f-ad6f-2c29613d8fec-0
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.960
Yeah, not a problem.

5cdc3cb6-121e-40dc-9655-12dc2c53d7c1-0
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.960
So this kind of went through a similar
thing, right?

6fadc8b7-9144-484a-aa10-7177d9d2ad7c-0
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.720
It's probably the next one, right?

9a932c27-e68b-466e-936b-c34846e7c1e4-0
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.306
So,
so at some point this was sort of saying,

9a932c27-e68b-466e-936b-c34846e7c1e4-1
00:24:45.306 --> 00:24:49.861
so we got our next Gen portal and there
were tip offs in there and we got rid of

9a932c27-e68b-466e-936b-c34846e7c1e4-2
00:24:49.861 --> 00:24:50.480
complaints.

53449ecc-ae45-4f3c-9f06-d0fecdfe73a4-0
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.560
I think that was this one.

df49e1a1-599a-446a-a5da-ae0266453293-0
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.920
When we went live with our new portal,
we got rid of Asqua Connect.

78501b1c-6aaf-4d17-8bf4-53443110856b-0
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.600
We're no longer storing complaints in
Asquinet.

9062b7d7-969d-4147-93b6-d727adce0131-0
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.600
We've now kind of got 2 systems in play.

29058c53-1140-4209-b2fa-1b8ea40da54e-0
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.760
Actually that was this one here.

54f96826-0812-4af2-a311-e00913f2b0c3-0
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.200
So we've got 2 systems in in play, right?

c1c6636b-b6ee-4738-bfa3-161660680b4f-0
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.688
Asquinet portal still doing most of
registration management ask,

c1c6636b-b6ee-4738-bfa3-161660680b4f-1
00:25:10.688 --> 00:25:12.760
we're still publishing to TGA.

39d03ff3-47cb-48ff-a5c2-ea81c8e238b4-0
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:18.880
All we've really done is remove the
complaints module out of here, right.

f39981d4-ecd0-4721-9484-358429995169-0
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.723
What happened on this other side,
on the arm side is we put our new portal

f39981d4-ecd0-4721-9484-358429995169-1
00:25:23.723 --> 00:25:26.353
in,
we've got the foundations of our modern

f39981d4-ecd0-4721-9484-358429995169-2
00:25:26.353 --> 00:25:29.880
data warehouse and sort of data and
reporting environment.

4660ec9b-0df1-46b6-9d5f-62af7636deb2-0
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:35.690
We now have tip offs and concerns over on
this right hand side and it's using kind

4660ec9b-0df1-46b6-9d5f-62af7636deb2-1
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.360
of cases in there as well.

f32e439b-dd8c-4784-86f7-e2cbf3c47fa9-0
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.160
So those are the two things that were
deprecated there.

1480adf9-cae4-45a7-860c-b8e8e63fd6a1-0
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.002
What we did,
which again you would have been around at

1480adf9-cae4-45a7-860c-b8e8e63fd6a1-1
00:25:44.002 --> 00:25:47.009
that time,
we did data flows to push organisations

1480adf9-cae4-45a7-860c-b8e8e63fd6a1-2
00:25:47.009 --> 00:25:51.490
contacts and some other data from
Asquinet across into arms just to support

1480adf9-cae4-45a7-860c-b8e8e63fd6a1-3
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.320
sort of those base functions that we had
there.

b2392be1-192e-4829-9479-dfc2745e3509-0
00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:00.480
So where we probably will be heading soon.

83e90adb-ca6c-4b99-80a7-60e0e14063d4-0
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.360
And so this is this transition point that
I sort of talked about, right.

a6e6b1e0-dc35-4bf9-b4ba-b97b41f8b32f-0
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.520
We've got the modern data warehouse.

db905841-5448-4d2c-abe2-57eb47226dd9-0
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.120
This was a point in time.

84b2ce43-e4a0-4e7e-9a12-e31b6fd2d21e-0
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.493
So you,
we will update this once you and Pradeep

84b2ce43-e4a0-4e7e-9a12-e31b6fd2d21e-1
00:26:10.493 --> 00:26:13.400
have defined what integration management
looks like for us.

ec92a8e8-b7c7-4a75-ac7b-7dea1d74a743-0
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.160
Yeah, yeah.

932c4667-d483-4580-9c70-800acc3f21a3-0
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.120
But my view kind of was we're no longer
publishing to TGA from Asquinet.

8a42a75f-7b7a-4eb2-90fe-3c7817b91242-0
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.760
Any Asquinet data is kind of ending up in
the data warehouse.

36f13bab-8bf2-45a0-8895-57c8c354c229-0
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.960
Anything that's happening in Arms is
ending up in the data warehouse.

07bffc5f-9ced-4dec-9ecb-76b9e41615bc-0
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.056
And in my head originally,
I was thinking we would publish to TGA

07bffc5f-9ced-4dec-9ecb-76b9e41615bc-1
00:26:33.056 --> 00:26:38.080
from the data warehouse instead of it
being directly hooked off ARMS.

4de5c11b-c02e-4e5c-afc6-f7466a72aa06-0
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.090
It was kind of like bring any residual
Asquinet data,

4de5c11b-c02e-4e5c-afc6-f7466a72aa06-1
00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:49.149
bring the ARMS data in curated in the
modern data warehouse and then publish it

4de5c11b-c02e-4e5c-afc6-f7466a72aa06-2
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.680
to TGA.

bd549379-ee07-466d-9188-ffc6771025f0-0
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.130
Yeah,
that is that is what I said to yesterday

bd549379-ee07-466d-9188-ffc6771025f0-1
00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.400
to Pradeep also.

68fcfd46-94c4-4763-b892-f0828ad52996-0
00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:00.476
So connecting to data was database
because the reconciliation will be a

68fcfd46-94c4-4763-b892-f0828ad52996-1
00:27:00.476 --> 00:27:01.040
problem.

a1b6b22a-8687-428b-9db9-ed20066f6076-0
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:01.800
Yeah.

2a891f70-ad5e-466a-8d5b-e307891f6339-0
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.991
We should have a a middleware somewhere
so that I can reconcile if any issues

2a891f70-ad5e-466a-8d5b-e307891f6339-1
00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:09.520
comes, I can say go here or come here.

068c707b-052f-4fac-9688-20a46b8317c1-0
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.280
Yeah.

9c2ee43e-cdbb-4820-8bd0-f1d9e479c7f0-0
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.120
So I need to have a nice dashboard.

078c229b-e59f-474e-b4ee-a36ea698cdb0-0
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.920
This this what we did before for Westpac
also.

07b7094a-5244-40bf-8a7f-185782426448-0
00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.800
So yeah,
this is how we need to have a middleware.

e0975d57-ac29-4d38-b0dc-22d23f294fca-0
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.890
So in the middleware there would be a
separate data system for the reporting

e0975d57-ac29-4d38-b0dc-22d23f294fca-1
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.760
and separate data for, you know,
push and pull model.

084d769f-9f42-4f07-9f0d-fc151e33e567-0
00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:27.720
Yep, Yep.

61520c1f-c032-4a3e-b5aa-5eeaabf9861c-0
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.760
And so the modern data warehouse,
it exists.

ab34b7b7-7b7d-4bc7-b1dd-8f2941dfbcba-0
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.680
We're we've got a new vendor in called
Playtime Solutions.

932c58e7-3d85-4529-984b-9ac06144b911-0
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.840
They're gonna build out the medallion
architecture, right.

6fd71970-9528-4f71-bb10-daff7ed31074-0
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.880
And so OK.

80f2a0c9-a71c-4635-992a-3821c9fda667-0
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.880
And so that's all in flight right now.

0e86a4ae-4ed7-439d-9fd3-9674e7357373-0
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.528
So all the infrastructure's built,
all the products are there and connected

0e86a4ae-4ed7-439d-9fd3-9674e7357373-1
00:27:46.528 --> 00:27:46.960
together.

a6c5e421-ffbc-4843-b993-f5e412723e9b-0
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.680
I don't think we're gonna use data bricks
any more.

61858c2a-2433-413c-990b-b906d75fffcf-0
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.812
I don't like, I,
I threw in service bus and,

61858c2a-2433-413c-990b-b906d75fffcf-1
00:27:52.812 --> 00:27:57.438
and API management services, but,
but this whole diagram about how we do

61858c2a-2433-413c-990b-b906d75fffcf-2
00:27:57.438 --> 00:27:58.960
this is going to change.

e2d21d03-aa61-49ac-9996-c69803158168-0
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.000
That's you and Pradeep to figure out what
the best model for that is.

8a59b460-d1bc-4de9-a794-eff26131b5cc-0
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.800
But,
but ultimately my thought was I don't

8a59b460-d1bc-4de9-a794-eff26131b5cc-1
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:12.440
want our publishing, our API's publishing,
consuming or publishing to run directly

8a59b460-d1bc-4de9-a794-eff26131b5cc-2
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.960
out of arms, right.

a7ba17af-5a00-4f69-bc38-7f8c0b162a16-0
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.520
And so,
and it sounds like we're on the same page.

bbd641da-a29d-485a-a965-05be462c8d4e-0
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.560
I don't want to connect to the source of
truth, you know, because that is wrong.

18fd5852-3f53-44a7-bafa-2e8e3e341e05-0
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.440
Yeah,
the middleware would be the nice to have.

d1cdb242-0f62-4d63-81a3-a488fdcf0a1b-0
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.400
Yeah, exactly.

04b6292e-0f22-49c3-88f4-f73128758f56-0
00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.440
It's a good solution.

47eec4d6-a99f-48d1-bd18-29b5082c0649-0
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.720
Otherwise it would be a problem.

a53eee10-dc73-48ed-b296-43469c09a5cb-0
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.400
Yeah, yeah.

e6595712-d1f9-48fb-b471-daad4faa0a16-0
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.676
And I think we've got just about
everything's kind of in place and

e6595712-d1f9-48fb-b471-daad4faa0a16-1
00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:32.560
provisioned, right.

1abe989f-2886-4129-8106-9af9f3eaf84b-0
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.920
So it's not like we're right back at the
starting point.

d295b081-51ff-40c5-ac0d-ddfbc89a9b58-0
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.677
It's just we haven't really defined well
how do we want to use some of the

d295b081-51ff-40c5-ac0d-ddfbc89a9b58-1
00:28:38.677 --> 00:28:40.280
services that we've already got.

a4d1df27-407c-492b-9731-f53c69e5a200-0
00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.058
And there's probably some additional ones
that we want to provision for, for,

a4d1df27-407c-492b-9731-f53c69e5a200-1
00:28:44.058 --> 00:28:46.236
you know,
the API sort of stuff or data sharing

a4d1df27-407c-492b-9731-f53c69e5a200-2
00:28:46.236 --> 00:28:47.279
kind of things as well.

7f366de8-549a-419d-86ae-1bdd839418cf-0
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.174
But, but in my head,
that's the approach I was hoping for was

7f366de8-549a-419d-86ae-1bdd839418cf-1
00:28:51.174 --> 00:28:56.120
that we disconnect publishing to TGA and
there's another one called Prisms, right?

4d41784e-b1c7-431a-8daa-0f38fc753150-0
00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.540
But disconnect that from being directly
in arms, do that,

4d41784e-b1c7-431a-8daa-0f38fc753150-1
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.360
do that from another layer somewhere.

b589e6d0-a5d0-4f06-8328-85d34ae59fe6-0
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.160
So sounds like we're on the same page,
right?

8bf9b488-e28b-4598-83a5-b814c2cf6594-0
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.248
The complexity we've got reporting over
here,

8bf9b488-e28b-4598-83a5-b814c2cf6594-1
00:29:08.248 --> 00:29:12.400
we've got a portal over here that's still
sort of pushing stuff into Aspinet.

5ef7a4c4-6e80-4476-a124-5b2a3dd680ee-0
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.760
We've got our new portal.

4d854ed5-47c5-4963-a6e1-e9ad19676ff2-0
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.042
So, so we're kind of, it's,
it's quite challenging while we've got 2

4d854ed5-47c5-4963-a6e1-e9ad19676ff2-1
00:29:18.042 --> 00:29:21.420
systems, but,
but the intention very quickly is to kind

4d854ed5-47c5-4963-a6e1-e9ad19676ff2-2
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.920
of end up here, right,
where there is no Aspinet anymore.

0a2cd143-8429-4934-a54b-3f51da4182ef-0
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.080
That stuff all sort of exists.

20f023f6-7446-43d7-b24d-aab5a243e4c4-0
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.240
The full portal exists there.

381652c8-f859-4ea8-bff2-bf2898071000-0
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.320
EDRMS is no longer objective.

cf835477-9de0-4999-ab84-9a46cab615dd-0
00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.776
It will be SharePoint with Castle Point
for records management sitting across the

cf835477-9de0-4999-ab84-9a46cab615dd-1
00:29:36.776 --> 00:29:37.320
top of it.

d70ddc88-ba7e-4dda-a683-6aba0ae9cc19-0
00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.271
Business Central has already been
uplifted as our financial management

d70ddc88-ba7e-4dda-a683-6aba0ae9cc19-1
00:29:42.271 --> 00:29:42.720
system.

f57d0044-fc2c-4344-8da6-1f9d77fb080e-0
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:49.200
And so it's sitting there ready to go for
us to build our new financial functions.

f1d5960f-12e7-4a09-b912-3acfc4cb7feb-0
00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.440
And we have a vendor for that called Tech
Infosys.

5cb084c1-8818-4430-bf9e-07d76c226be2-0
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.960
OK, I will introduce you to Taran.

01db5130-8757-4045-ab1a-91a09a43100c-0
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.840
He's a great bloke.

0035d86b-d2ea-49cd-801e-336564537278-0
00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:01.948
He built our original finance function
for Aspinet as a as a contractor to ASPA

0035d86b-d2ea-49cd-801e-336564537278-1
00:30:01.948 --> 00:30:04.120
and then started his own business.

6b47af18-1496-4bdf-9fca-23d64b941ed5-0
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.574
And he's had the support contract the
whole time,

6b47af18-1496-4bdf-9fca-23d64b941ed5-1
00:30:06.574 --> 00:30:08.440
introduced me while starting this one.

943c6166-160a-4766-8d53-ab8cd5c99aa6-0
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.120
I think he's from Infosys or something
right before Tech Infosys.

45aa41b0-a32d-4929-b3f6-33cd374d95cf-0
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.080
He's the own company,
but it's Tech Infosys.

b0c11f8c-8c2f-4e50-a5f7-0e06fd7cd950-0
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.283
Yeah, so,
so I'm just working through a statement

b0c11f8c-8c2f-4e50-a5f7-0e06fd7cd950-1
00:30:17.283 --> 00:30:21.959
of work for him to come on and start
building all of our finance sort of

b0c11f8c-8c2f-4e50-a5f7-0e06fd7cd950-2
00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:22.600
functions.

6ff2cfe2-a945-4fae-ade9-6ec31fef6714-0
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.536
So, so at the moment,
Asquinet's portal calls Asquinet to

6ff2cfe2-a945-4fae-ade9-6ec31fef6714-1
00:30:26.536 --> 00:30:31.763
generate an invoice and once it's done
that it puts it into an XML file that

6ff2cfe2-a945-4fae-ade9-6ec31fef6714-2
00:30:31.763 --> 00:30:33.800
gets sent to Business Central.

f4a2f3c9-5f2d-4bfd-9282-a2608a0527b8-0
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.915
And then payments come into Business
Central and it tries to update Asquinet

f4a2f3c9-5f2d-4bfd-9282-a2608a0527b8-1
00:30:37.915 --> 00:30:40.320
and,
and the the whole thing never balances.

9408e0d6-7710-46b8-84d2-887e8e89c488-0
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.539
And so the mandate here is the Business
Central manages all of our finance

9408e0d6-7710-46b8-84d2-887e8e89c488-1
00:30:44.539 --> 00:30:45.440
function, right.

fa88ab60-db85-438e-bfa5-75012eb69440-0
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.122
If we need an invoice on the portal and I,
we haven't defined how this would work,

fa88ab60-db85-438e-bfa5-75012eb69440-1
00:30:50.122 --> 00:30:53.849
but there's a call that just says here's
what I need an invoice for,

fa88ab60-db85-438e-bfa5-75012eb69440-2
00:30:53.849 --> 00:30:55.200
just give me the invoice.

6ab64bcd-c3d4-4708-8149-1cef499f192d-0
00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.571
And so that's something Taran will sort
of work with us on the architecture piece

6ab64bcd-c3d4-4708-8149-1cef499f192d-1
00:31:00.571 --> 00:31:03.200
of how do we want all of this to hang
together?

06f7fa69-02ba-4932-ac97-47d0b250e112-0
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:08.314
But he'll be part of our team and part of
Honeybee's team to build out any of those

06f7fa69-02ba-4932-ac97-47d0b250e112-1
00:31:08.314 --> 00:31:10.320
finance sort of related functions.

e2ee9c40-cb57-4edc-a6c2-8710b4742b00-0
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.460
OK, so,
so Business Central's kinda critical for

e2ee9c40-cb57-4edc-a6c2-8710b4742b00-1
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.080
us in this new world.

6fe7f17b-e905-4a55-91c9-cb000914507b-0
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.883
SharePoint needy RMS done by Castle Point
Business Central managing our finance

6fe7f17b-e905-4a55-91c9-cb000914507b-1
00:31:22.883 --> 00:31:26.701
function and,
and and the finance team uses that for

6fe7f17b-e905-4a55-91c9-cb000914507b-2
00:31:26.701 --> 00:31:30.520
end of month, end of quarter,
end of year processes.

f151143b-50ce-4204-af27-0c5da667903c-0
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:35.160
They report data out of Business Central
up to the government's finance system.

a5254471-e33f-4673-9c00-8a5110dff921-0
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:43.003
They receive RBA payment files that they
import in to match up all of our payments

a5254471-e33f-4673-9c00-8a5110dff921-1
00:31:43.003 --> 00:31:44.360
that were received.

5ca40bc4-4285-4292-9e96-9b07e67e632d-0
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.080
And so it's kind of a a really central
function.

d418376a-b3a1-44b3-97de-1c7bc1083ebf-0
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.200
The advantage we've got is finance is
like it works perfectly for us.

ec4dbb3b-5125-4476-94db-716064b53b5a-0
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.554
So all we did was move it from an on Prem
solution,

ec4dbb3b-5125-4476-94db-716064b53b5a-1
00:31:55.554 --> 00:32:00.135
upgrade it to the latest online cloud
solution and it's now inside our

ec4dbb3b-5125-4476-94db-716064b53b5a-2
00:32:00.135 --> 00:32:02.200
environment as a cloud solution.

09dbf1d9-98b3-4719-9182-53ba3a06015a-0
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.480
But it's really just servicing Asquinet
right now.

ff3afbd5-5eed-437a-b844-85f9414d3adf-0
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.160
The next step is to make IT service the
arms environment as well.

f9d8c144-3d18-453e-9a69-00e6fd8444ac-0
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.280
OK, got it.

29d58fb3-43d7-43a5-9f9d-a35c53ace4d6-0
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.520
And yeah, modern data warehouse, right.

f062a99e-4316-4968-89dc-c41bab325acf-0
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.265
So,
so those are just a couple of high level

f062a99e-4316-4968-89dc-c41bab325acf-1
00:32:18.265 --> 00:32:22.760
diagrams about this transition piece if I
go back to.

acfed3ea-9755-4cef-bb7b-090b4105cf5f-0
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:32.402
And so intelligence was kind of the first
real case processing piece to that,

acfed3ea-9755-4cef-bb7b-090b4105cf5f-1
00:32:32.402 --> 00:32:35.360
the proper UCM case processing.

97ff4457-f5cc-4bae-8fd5-162bfe1ea460-0
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.858
Yeah,
qualification integrity sort of came out

97ff4457-f5cc-4bae-8fd5-162bfe1ea460-1
00:32:39.858 --> 00:32:41.600
from off to the side.

d7af205e-34fe-432e-a6d9-e4660513ed2b-0
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:46.092
And so the,
the back story to it is what we found was

d7af205e-34fe-432e-a6d9-e4660513ed2b-1
00:32:46.092 --> 00:32:51.830
there was a lot of training, not a lot,
but a bunch of training providers who

d7af205e-34fe-432e-a6d9-e4660513ed2b-2
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:57.200
realised we have a function that's called
recognition of prior learning.

64a556ba-5926-4d8d-88ef-a6863ced5a0a-0
00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.684
And so if I turn up to a training
provider and say,

64a556ba-5926-4d8d-88ef-a6863ced5a0a-1
00:33:00.684 --> 00:33:05.134
here's all of this documentation and
assignments and all of this stuff that

64a556ba-5926-4d8d-88ef-a6863ced5a0a-2
00:33:05.134 --> 00:33:07.768
I've done,
all this work in another training

64a556ba-5926-4d8d-88ef-a6863ced5a0a-3
00:33:07.768 --> 00:33:12.335
provider on another training product,
but it's applicable here, they can say,

64a556ba-5926-4d8d-88ef-a6863ced5a0a-4
00:33:12.335 --> 00:33:15.087
well,
we'll recognise that you've already done

64a556ba-5926-4d8d-88ef-a6863ced5a0a-5
00:33:15.087 --> 00:33:18.600
all of the work here for us to give you
that qualification.

72eb1ecd-64b2-4069-800c-79ddbb829c45-0
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:19.640
OK.

111101bb-cd10-4b8e-98d7-cc616f638f84-0
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.170
And So what people were doing was they
were just going give us $2000,

111101bb-cd10-4b8e-98d7-cc616f638f84-1
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:28.360
send us a photo of you working with
children and we'll just give you a

111101bb-cd10-4b8e-98d7-cc616f638f84-2
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.600
qualification, right?

69a33376-a138-40ee-a247-d27d8b9813d8-0
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.924
And so,
so the qualification integrity process is

69a33376-a138-40ee-a247-d27d8b9813d8-1
00:33:33.924 --> 00:33:39.827
about saying not only is that provider
not no longer meeting the requirements of

69a33376-a138-40ee-a247-d27d8b9813d8-2
00:33:39.827 --> 00:33:43.690
being a provider,
they issued a whole lot of kind of

69a33376-a138-40ee-a247-d27d8b9813d8-3
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.440
fraudulent certificates.

141d759d-68a6-4900-a671-513a70047b2c-0
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.823
And so qualification integrity is going
out to those students and going, well,

141d759d-68a6-4900-a671-513a70047b2c-1
00:33:49.823 --> 00:33:52.320
you're cancelling your qualification,
right?

f8161473-1d99-4d0d-8fc5-3498365b446d-0
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:58.040
Really impactful because these people are
using it for their job, right?

60a9e74e-20b9-42fb-8b5e-cff3b55db95a-0
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.394
So,
so people are losing their jobs because

60a9e74e-20b9-42fb-8b5e-cff3b55db95a-1
00:34:00.394 --> 00:34:02.749
their qualifications are getting
cancelled,

60a9e74e-20b9-42fb-8b5e-cff3b55db95a-2
00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:05.800
which means they can no longer work in
those industries.

852b5ad0-7ead-4d8a-8a53-a3810f27cbcc-0
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:12.160
So very public facing the big potential.

12002050-0d8b-4702-b8ec-97cb376b6bea-0
00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.000
The some of these are 6000 students,
right?

874948e5-96df-416e-a2ac-811e437649c4-0
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.915
It's more than our provider community,
the number of people we would be

874948e5-96df-416e-a2ac-811e437649c4-1
00:34:18.915 --> 00:34:19.840
interacting with.

9e4f442e-3bf7-4a62-aed8-c0e7e45b3b35-0
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.153
And so qualification integrity was the
first one where it's like we get this

9e4f442e-3bf7-4a62-aed8-c0e7e45b3b35-1
00:34:27.153 --> 00:34:32.374
massive volume of data that we have to
bring in to enable people to go to the

9e4f442e-3bf7-4a62-aed8-c0e7e45b3b35-2
00:34:32.374 --> 00:34:37.862
portal to register to, to respond to us,
to tell us why we shouldn't cancel their

9e4f442e-3bf7-4a62-aed8-c0e7e45b3b35-3
00:34:37.862 --> 00:34:38.800
qualification.

c1e39929-6156-41b0-853a-4f4103c5578e-0
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.783
And you would have seen the start of that,
right,

c1e39929-6156-41b0-853a-4f4103c5578e-1
00:34:43.783 --> 00:34:46.880
the Danuca bit where he was refining that
import solution.

774fa49c-4223-456d-8c96-2cb9964d71c5-0
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:58.160
That was the solution that was built
using ADF and largely sort of evolved.

a1eb1772-b840-4e8b-8267-5fe65fdf7a38-0
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.407
So when we first started building
qualification integrity, we thought, oh,

a1eb1772-b840-4e8b-8267-5fe65fdf7a38-1
00:35:02.407 --> 00:35:07.051
we could probably just build a couple of
compound keys and use the out of the box

a1eb1772-b840-4e8b-8267-5fe65fdf7a38-2
00:35:07.051 --> 00:35:10.280
import functionality that had too much
complexity in it.

a507ee67-a63f-4212-9401-a287b8e57dc6-0
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.831
So we got away from that and we ended up
we in hindsight,

a507ee67-a63f-4212-9401-a287b8e57dc6-1
00:35:13.831 --> 00:35:17.200
maybe we could have done this using data
flows, right?

0a8d5878-471f-4583-8a8d-d1aa89a2c029-0
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.449
But we used ADF to do it,
but the performance on the ADF side was

0a8d5878-471f-4583-8a8d-d1aa89a2c029-1
00:35:21.449 --> 00:35:22.480
really terrible.

59daba81-0c36-44cc-8c9f-e491472ca219-0
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.116
And so, yeah, and,
and even like even the way it was

59daba81-0c36-44cc-8c9f-e491472ca219-1
00:35:26.116 --> 00:35:29.645
implemented, you know,
they were doing multiple queries for

59daba81-0c36-44cc-8c9f-e491472ca219-2
00:35:29.645 --> 00:35:31.880
things that they didn't need to query.

072fa1d7-0fdf-4434-9830-a3f69869783c-0
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.920
It was slowing it down.

7e3342cc-251c-48b9-aec0-7f177ecf3519-0
00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:37.937
All of those issues that we had,
it worked largely reliably that import

7e3342cc-251c-48b9-aec0-7f177ecf3519-1
00:35:37.937 --> 00:35:41.840
solution for the 6000 impacted
individuals that we had.

976298ea-c20b-4782-84cd-514aa7234d05-0
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.297
But if they go to 100,
000 impacted individuals,

976298ea-c20b-4782-84cd-514aa7234d05-1
00:35:45.297 --> 00:35:50.160
The thing is going to run for a week and
it's, it's just not a viable solution.

9b9bbc61-f6c3-44bb-a72e-cfdd85c875ef-0
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:56.256
So it starts with us getting a list of
all of the students that they want to

9b9bbc61-f6c3-44bb-a72e-cfdd85c875ef-1
00:35:56.256 --> 00:36:02.274
cancel their qualifications for and we
massage that data through the import

9b9bbc61-f6c3-44bb-a72e-cfdd85c875ef-2
00:36:02.274 --> 00:36:08.846
solution to bring that in and effectively
create the impacted individual as a as a

9b9bbc61-f6c3-44bb-a72e-cfdd85c875ef-3
00:36:08.846 --> 00:36:09.479
contact.

2adf7a1d-ac06-44e1-badc-e276a2621f33-0
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.333
There's an ARN type of record that holds
the, you know,

2adf7a1d-ac06-44e1-badc-e276a2621f33-1
00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:19.333
this is the unique kind of challenge
values that we're gonna challenge you

2adf7a1d-ac06-44e1-badc-e276a2621f33-2
00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:20.800
with when you sign up.

f8989879-c3e8-4445-8cd6-58ef3c35cfe4-0
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:26.360
And also all of the qualifications and
how long they've got to respond for those.

c0345ad4-3cb0-4a10-8053-e18ad433783f-0
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.600
Some of them are high priority,
some of them are a lower priority.

088d787f-abd7-4596-a15d-90eacdab7519-0
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:36.010
So the way the process works is they use
Vision 6 to send out an email to all 6000

088d787f-abd7-4596-a15d-90eacdab7519-1
00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:41.880
of those people and they use that IRN
that we've generated on that Vision 6

088d787f-abd7-4596-a15d-90eacdab7519-2
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.205
email to say, hey,
you're gonna have to register on our

088d787f-abd7-4596-a15d-90eacdab7519-3
00:36:46.205 --> 00:36:48.600
portal or sign into our portal.

bf17929f-b323-4d5c-8345-d71b87966c63-0
00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.767
If you're registering,
you'll need to use this IRN and put your

bf17929f-b323-4d5c-8345-d71b87966c63-1
00:36:52.767 --> 00:36:53.800
date of birth in.

db23f687-bb5c-4282-91f4-6ecaddc332f0-0
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.717
And once you're registered,
your records will appear in front of you

db23f687-bb5c-4282-91f4-6ecaddc332f0-1
00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:01.960
for to be able to, you know,
submit a form.

4604e8dc-dc18-4e5e-bdfc-724f9b014d32-0
00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.000
Why we shouldn't cancel your
qualification.

90df5e40-fd36-41e8-a7a5-a840f9f3eb92-0
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.461
If you've already been cancelled or you
already have a portal account,

90df5e40-fd36-41e8-a7a5-a840f9f3eb92-1
00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:12.446
there's also a manual way that you can
just click on the add IRN button to add

90df5e40-fd36-41e8-a7a5-a840f9f3eb92-2
00:37:12.446 --> 00:37:16.280
another provider to your list of ones
that you're we're cancelling for you.

efa68c74-b803-43c8-adfc-a4b5c66c2228-0
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.589
They basically go through that submission
of, you know,

efa68c74-b803-43c8-adfc-a4b5c66c2228-1
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:24.279
I've been working in childcare for 10
years and look,

efa68c74-b803-43c8-adfc-a4b5c66c2228-2
00:37:24.279 --> 00:37:26.920
here's videos of me being really good
with children.

fe820899-b0e5-4127-a587-ec80bb38375b-0
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.000
Largely Ask her is still cancelling the
qualifications, right.

71c761f5-0d0c-4028-bbce-f0640479b5b4-0
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.040
There's not a lot that they've said, OK,
we won't cancel your qualification.

3e718c32-f28a-48f4-a937-1aee7d26ecb4-0
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.735
But they go through a case process to do
due diligence and make sure they assess

3e718c32-f28a-48f4-a937-1aee7d26ecb4-1
00:37:39.735 --> 00:37:40.560
their evidence.

9ab7db75-fe70-4617-8868-2ff26be13b6a-0
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.440
And then the outcome of that is to cancel
or not to cancel.

2e29722e-42b0-4dde-9ba1-5cb1af458d38-0
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.360
Yeah, Yeah, that's good.

03021812-edc6-4a81-9909-e39585cdd04d-0
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.160
I didn't look that import solution.

ace14c58-e19b-4c2a-a1eb-e06811f6326c-0
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.840
I need to look that one.

751f6c5f-b297-4408-9eec-b14b6277c089-0
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:52.760
Yeah.

ce81f440-9333-4c2b-ae40-2e0a4f265809-0
00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:57.315
And and so right now I'll, I'll,
I'll actually go and have a chat to the

ce81f440-9333-4c2b-ae40-2e0a4f265809-1
00:37:57.315 --> 00:37:59.000
the business owner of that.

575bf53f-85a2-480b-913f-b58a5e760072-0
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.882
I don't think we're like it's not super
critical that we replace that import

575bf53f-85a2-480b-913f-b58a5e760072-1
00:38:03.882 --> 00:38:08.004
solution with Danukas,
but it is a new year thing that we should

575bf53f-85a2-480b-913f-b58a5e760072-2
00:38:08.004 --> 00:38:12.000
start having a plan for when we think we
could do that, right.

1cf4af4c-a9a5-42c8-ac81-90f9d42cd49a-0
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.640
So I will review and I can come with
welcome.

b5859ef6-5d38-410f-8116-d3f158fc1094-0
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.840
I'll review and let you know where the
blocks are, how now we can rectify that.

1143d585-de8e-461a-b63e-8f7d7017c67c-0
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7d7b8ca6-bfa3-4380-b4da-9f4872079bab-0
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.164
So, so for me that if that was a February,
March one that we, you know,

7d7b8ca6-bfa3-4380-b4da-9f4872079bab-1
00:38:26.164 --> 00:38:29.693
you've reviewed it,
you you've identified a few ways that we

7d7b8ca6-bfa3-4380-b4da-9f4872079bab-2
00:38:29.693 --> 00:38:33.280
could productionize it and we're ready to
go into production.

19401a9c-8634-460d-96ab-a8408dc99a8c-0
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.520
I'm fine with that, right.

87923991-6abd-4e47-b62b-5284d0934bf5-0
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.334
It's not something that, yeah,
it's not a January 15 that we have to

87923991-6abd-4e47-b62b-5284d0934bf5-1
00:38:38.334 --> 00:38:39.440
uplift the solution.

928f1fe9-31e5-417e-8c24-3233a5ff9850-0
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.900
But like because Danuka did so much work
on it,

928f1fe9-31e5-417e-8c24-3233a5ff9850-1
00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.720
I don't want it to just sort of sit in
the background.

6161ba73-e930-4165-af1b-9bc75bd6244a-0
00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.764
I think it makes real sense for us to
have, you know,

6161ba73-e930-4165-af1b-9bc75bd6244a-1
00:38:47.764 --> 00:38:51.880
I think the error handling is probably a
lot better in the new solution.

0b6d0d1f-bad8-4af9-91b3-48a570c54973-0
00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.178
We saw a couple of examples where 4 date
of births failed to come across when we

0b6d0d1f-bad8-4af9-91b3-48a570c54973-1
00:38:56.178 --> 00:39:00.062
imported the records and there was no
error reporting on the fact that that

0b6d0d1f-bad8-4af9-91b3-48a570c54973-2
00:39:00.062 --> 00:39:00.880
happened, right.

dc487487-8265-4da7-aada-7bc00bfc9177-0
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:06.150
So it's a bit of an uplift of that sort
of error handling and reporting in,

dc487487-8265-4da7-aada-7bc00bfc9177-1
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.520
in that new process as well,
but but kind of a lower priority.

e3792320-971d-45f2-a43f-71f24835f5ad-0
00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.520
I just don't want to lose focus on it.

2df98d55-2d81-405f-882c-143a1d508662-0
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:19.200
So there was the import solution,
probably a good segue into the file copy.

db22e638-c5ee-4142-94b3-9d1f7fa26924-0
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.920
So, so when people upload things,
it ends up in BLOB storage.

4d70478c-958b-4d6c-a99a-cd967075b5ce-0
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.482
And then we've got this logic app that
goes and picks it up and, you know,

4d70478c-958b-4d6c-a99a-cd967075b5ce-1
00:39:26.482 --> 00:39:29.958
it's got a little bit of duplicate
detection and some metadata mapping in

4d70478c-958b-4d6c-a99a-cd967075b5ce-2
00:39:29.958 --> 00:39:30.240
there.

5ef311a7-b2be-49af-8c10-addf5f2ece55-0
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.240
And it sticks the files into SharePoint.

fcffa9c7-9953-47b6-866e-954843897deb-0
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.120
And for the most part,
that's been working reliably.

1a1bf364-ac59-4170-9624-c6df8bf38953-0
00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.900
But Danuka again went and had a look at
it and said,

1a1bf364-ac59-4170-9624-c6df8bf38953-1
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.880
I think there's a better way of doing a
better performance, better error handling.

d69a83de-9304-447a-87f4-c168dfe564ee-0
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:50.405
And it was kind of a combo logic app
function app kind of solution that he

d69a83de-9304-447a-87f4-c168dfe564ee-1
00:39:50.405 --> 00:39:53.720
built again, that looked really good,
right?

6b527bb1-d657-473a-9c0a-b3a9c273fca2-0
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.128
And so it's exactly the same both that
file copy and the import solution of

6b527bb1-d657-473a-9c0a-b3a9c273fca2-1
00:40:00.128 --> 00:40:02.760
things that I do want to productionize.

106d5bdc-1814-4566-a1bd-939bec748b60-0
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.040
But we're managing OK in the short term.

a73918c5-96ef-4e50-a710-709ee7c39ab6-0
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.840
So they're not our highest priority.

e4cc30d2-6b1e-46b0-971d-b7ff6e6e2c26-0
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.192
But yet it's kind of a secondary one for
you is to is to, yeah,

e4cc30d2-6b1e-46b0-971d-b7ff6e6e2c26-1
00:40:12.192 --> 00:40:15.320
progress those ones along towards
production.

898affc5-384b-4c4a-8e85-e837a973a1a9-0
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.600
No problem at all.

9ec5bad8-f987-456e-a395-72b7bdbdb951-0
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.000
Yeah.

4a9a0951-4441-455a-94c9-603f76f1ba61-0
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:23.628
So I think if we went into dev,
we'd also see a registration management

4a9a0951-4441-455a-94c9-603f76f1ba61-1
00:40:23.628 --> 00:40:28.920
app and that is where all of the new
stuff is going to come along, right?

7d18509c-6b3d-411e-ad11-60ade2fb42bc-0
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.500
And,
and I've got a view because everybody's

7d18509c-6b3d-411e-ad11-60ade2fb42bc-1
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.515
sort of working in their own apps and,
and there's some inconsistencies between

7d18509c-6b3d-411e-ad11-60ade2fb42bc-2
00:40:38.515 --> 00:40:39.080
language.

7565e4f4-80ce-4e2d-be96-12cebfb936d6-0
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:44.600
If I go into the Qi app,
they call accounts RTO's, right?

87aab49d-0af6-4a79-85f8-0c890ec820d5-0
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.731
And that makes sense in there because
that's how that team sort of refers to

87aab49d-0af6-4a79-85f8-0c890ec820d5-1
00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:49.000
them.

5a3e2392-15b9-401f-82ac-4790199c9442-0
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.184
If I go to the intelligence app,
the account record is probably called

5a3e2392-15b9-401f-82ac-4790199c9442-1
00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:55.960
provider or it's just been left as
account, right?

9ab7837d-3efc-4fca-a4e1-95e628115fa7-0
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.240
So we kind of got all of these.

4437a955-155f-4f2a-8f9f-e086b50ceee1-0
00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:03.823
We've got 4 solutions that were largely
built by 4 different teams and there's

4437a955-155f-4f2a-8f9f-e086b50ceee1-1
00:41:03.823 --> 00:41:06.560
some inconsistency across those, right?

0557d9e7-472f-43b9-b2d9-edb96fb37bb8-0
00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.349
And so part of what you may and Pradeep,
what I wanna try and do is go,

0557d9e7-472f-43b9-b2d9-edb96fb37bb8-1
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:12.665
we're gonna put in registration
management,

0557d9e7-472f-43b9-b2d9-edb96fb37bb8-2
00:41:12.665 --> 00:41:16.560
then we're gonna put in performance
assessment and compliance management.

3520da7f-b26f-4791-ab87-44d28c8f467b-0
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:22.247
Now is the time for us to sort of
standardise some of the language things,

3520da7f-b26f-4791-ab87-44d28c8f467b-1
00:41:22.247 --> 00:41:27.727
but also what is the overarching app
someone might go to to see everything,

3520da7f-b26f-4791-ab87-44d28c8f467b-2
00:41:27.727 --> 00:41:28.160
right.

fbfb3415-68fe-4619-9c0a-961256e3f062-0
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.385
So, so I, I,
I don't think we've really landed the

fbfb3415-68fe-4619-9c0a-961256e3f062-1
00:41:31.385 --> 00:41:34.611
future of,
of sort of app management and how we're

fbfb3415-68fe-4619-9c0a-961256e3f062-2
00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:38.722
going to make it all come together once
all of the teams are in,

fbfb3415-68fe-4619-9c0a-961256e3f062-3
00:41:38.722 --> 00:41:40.240
in the arms environment.

519be3a5-544f-4f32-8a92-681de47be26c-0
00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.280
So, yeah.

660862d6-6a77-481e-b205-43e7c77c46c8-0
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.640
And so that's kind of where we're at.

4ac28505-7b5d-4a13-9976-3fd7b2c3ce62-0
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.320
No problem.

8b2bedb7-d6a8-4861-b780-d4ce20d5bef2-0
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.120
This is too much of information.

e75820c0-eb1c-4b19-b342-76d73f8c001b-0
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:59.349
I will go through this and I'll I'll do a
nice understanding and I'll do on a road

e75820c0-eb1c-4b19-b342-76d73f8c001b-1
00:41:59.349 --> 00:42:03.720
map and I'll keep it with my list so I
can hit one by one.

ba60386e-f01c-4c5f-9cdd-9fb5f79f7a72-0
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.360
Yeah, perfect.

80c54dfe-c63c-43f9-8fef-2b96842a44d2-0
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.560
And so, yeah, let's stop it there, right.

e6d2245a-ff40-4cdf-bcbb-77296c5adb32-0
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.840
So, so go away,
do a bit of digestion of that.

8d78a4f9-104d-4088-a378-743f228f4e8a-0
00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.280
And this again, right.

ed245750-42ba-4597-8567-ef78b3ef2f78-0
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.074
We've got until next Wednesday,
but I think from Friday people are gonna

ed245750-42ba-4597-8567-ef78b3ef2f78-1
00:42:15.074 --> 00:42:16.000
start disappearing.

b62b11cd-c999-4a63-b02a-fad7cd418a1f-0
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.800
And so this time is really good to just
get you up to need.

fae1c19c-0a44-4ee3-bdd9-0f045d2d2d2a-0
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.605
And I think you'll be able to start to do
a little bit of a deep dive on, you know,

fae1c19c-0a44-4ee3-bdd9-0f045d2d2d2a-1
00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:27.640
the highest priority sort of ones like
the the, the sign up stuff.

e4f4dd83-af12-446d-8da8-1ed1e4fe5c4d-0
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.851
Yeah,
my plan is to get all the access sorted

e4f4dd83-af12-446d-8da8-1ed1e4fe5c4d-1
00:42:30.851 --> 00:42:33.663
out,
do a little bit of like a deployment and

e4f4dd83-af12-446d-8da8-1ed1e4fe5c4d-2
00:42:33.663 --> 00:42:36.720
see whether the changes are playing there
or not.

8079d2bc-4520-432a-b18e-a8f622555f80-0
00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.517
So in the holidays,
I'll digest all the code and Yep,

8079d2bc-4520-432a-b18e-a8f622555f80-1
00:42:40.517 --> 00:42:43.160
start the newer, I'll start the RMA fresh.

ac3307e3-9208-4f24-984b-eff5dca7c5bc-0
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.320
Yep, Yep.

cc0c9732-8502-404e-a0c9-2939dcbf8b9c-0
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.120
That's yeah, absolutely fine.

672883b5-653e-4417-bb86-b9d88e05e206-0
00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:50.232
So, yeah,
and then I think we can probably start

672883b5-653e-4417-bb86-b9d88e05e206-1
00:42:50.232 --> 00:42:54.680
doing some deeper dives on the individual
solutions.

ff14775a-fd1b-42af-b82e-89c15b740af0-0
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.473
Like I want to talk you and me and
Pradeep about with qualification

ff14775a-fd1b-42af-b82e-89c15b740af0-1
00:42:59.473 --> 00:43:04.760
integrity, we put in that ARN solution,
ask for a reference number, right?

32a9e12d-d8b1-4ef8-a223-13422086695c-0
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.840
Just a randomly generated number that we
send out to people.

1672492e-4e04-493a-be56-66666400f467-0
00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.240
The portal in the future is all going to
be invitation only, right?

bdb9f921-3503-4b01-8be5-faff9aa16d95-0
00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.104
So you won't be able to go to our new
portal and just go,

bdb9f921-3503-4b01-8be5-faff9aa16d95-1
00:43:16.104 --> 00:43:17.240
I just want to sign up.

9f9f0b60-e50a-413b-9e94-51dcef02016d-0
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.480
You could probably click on the sign up
button, right?

14e1b09b-9b0a-4355-a456-c8587b1c754c-0
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.089
But you've gotta have a challenge
question that we've provided to you and

14e1b09b-9b0a-4355-a456-c8587b1c754c-1
00:43:24.089 --> 00:43:26.040
that is basically this reference number.

7a915503-d1ff-4cb3-a97a-505a62e69199-0
00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.660
And so I wanted,
but what we implemented for qualification

7a915503-d1ff-4cb3-a97a-505a62e69199-1
00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:36.240
integrity probably isn't the overall
model that we want for the entire portal.

fd829715-e3bd-443b-94a8-a7e5cffc2f36-0
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.025
So as you start getting into sign up for
RMA,

fd829715-e3bd-443b-94a8-a7e5cffc2f36-1
00:43:39.025 --> 00:43:43.991
I want us to also go and have a look at
how can we uplift the the ASQUA reference

fd829715-e3bd-443b-94a8-a7e5cffc2f36-2
00:43:43.991 --> 00:43:48.715
number solution to make it consistent
across everything we're gonna do moving

fd829715-e3bd-443b-94a8-a7e5cffc2f36-3
00:43:48.715 --> 00:43:49.200
forward.

9eb29127-93d2-4313-ad83-15ac1acc8c0d-0
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.360
But that's really the main focus, right?

d82a9880-3789-4347-8bfd-b887c5925066-0
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.271
Just get yourself up to speed,
get your knowledge back up,

d82a9880-3789-4347-8bfd-b887c5925066-1
00:43:55.271 --> 00:44:00.508
but but sort of just target that sign in
sign up kind of piece of RMA to start

d82a9880-3789-4347-8bfd-b887c5925066-2
00:44:00.508 --> 00:44:00.840
with.

bd2de802-5786-460c-9dc5-dafa73ef1b29-0
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.600
Yeah, Good.

ec777649-cb62-4f10-b2cb-1a7200181afe-0
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.680
Interesting, Jamie, very interesting.

b5005ec2-c114-4f41-8f8b-8c929df0a4fa-0
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.280
Yeah, I'm going to love this.

ecad8815-fbfb-4c09-8333-9aaa74d9ef3a-0
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.200
Yeah.

298cd107-b820-4a7b-aa7b-6ffdc71a2329-0
00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:08.560
And yeah.

b88ef7a5-63ec-4fee-b6ba-e44d044ec00a-0
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.112
But mate, there is so much this,
those slides that I showed you was to to

b88ef7a5-63ec-4fee-b6ba-e44d044ec00a-1
00:44:13.112 --> 00:44:16.800
say to people like there is so much work
to get done, right.

cc84d53b-2cb0-48de-a36e-1cd37ed44dc0-0
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.320
And we're a pretty small team.

fe1c27fc-cf46-4a10-8dc1-7aabccc0618b-0
00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.493
It's like we've got to be really,
really smart and efficient if we're going

fe1c27fc-cf46-4a10-8dc1-7aabccc0618b-1
00:44:21.493 --> 00:44:22.120
to get it done.

01aec89a-788d-482f-b016-e1f6cfd5a967-0
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.480
But yeah,
they're already starting to sort of think

01aec89a-788d-482f-b016-e1f6cfd5a967-1
00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.033
maybe June 2027,
they're not going to have 100% of the

01aec89a-788d-482f-b016-e1f6cfd5a967-2
00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:29.680
work done.

e3153717-6a13-46c0-b307-9cc9689e8d42-0
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.160
So they're already starting to talk about
how it'll extend after that as well.

e8be9772-e99f-4a9d-9c1a-339a8ca6aeb9-0
00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.280
So yeah, I think there's,
there's plenty for us to sort of go on

e8be9772-e99f-4a9d-9c1a-339a8ca6aeb9-1
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:36.760
with then.

d274b44c-5833-4f10-825c-e80ea0e39646-0
00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:37.600
Yeah.

b85a499f-a50d-4ebf-9c59-5b338894f9ac-0
00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.693
So I I don't know because I just in a
request I see,

b85a499f-a50d-4ebf-9c59-5b338894f9ac-1
00:44:41.693 --> 00:44:46.602
but if you have some contact,
you can let me know because you know this

b85a499f-a50d-4ebf-9c59-5b338894f9ac-2
00:44:46.602 --> 00:44:48.919
laptop is not with the spec issue.

e171cbe0-2b75-4dd6-9d16-64e4b79a5d31-0
00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.403
This laptop is really good,
but the issue is with their blocking,

e171cbe0-2b75-4dd6-9d16-64e4b79a5d31-1
00:44:53.403 --> 00:44:53.800
right?

8c4604b1-44db-4fc3-8fa8-5ff0721f50c9-0
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:54.320
Yep.

62b759e2-934d-4d10-8468-42cb267528a8-0
00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:59.283
All if I want to look in a Microsoft and
architecture and I want to go and look

62b759e2-934d-4d10-8468-42cb267528a8-1
00:44:59.283 --> 00:45:02.360
some other documents,
most of the teams are blocked.

69fcb131-a944-4ca4-a7ab-9e67b0150c6d-0
00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.693
So what I want to do is I want to email
that link to my personal computer,

69fcb131-a944-4ca4-a7ab-9e67b0150c6d-1
00:45:06.693 --> 00:45:08.600
then I want to get it from there.

8c9a12ba-333f-442a-ab69-bcee2208f8b3-0
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.640
You know, it's like a time diversity.

82629f07-2f4e-4c6d-8c33-8602c78e132a-0
00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.320
Yeah.

f1231d1c-5a65-499b-b86f-c3b3cafd204f-0
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.360
Is there anything we can get in a VM?

6583f36e-3516-4bfb-af09-623c2ad2005b-0
00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.840
I don't want to connect to any
environment of this Asqua.

b99e346f-b8ad-451b-8ffc-2817b587b6e1-0
00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.520
I don't want anything to this Asqua
related, just a VM.

a864bda5-32c5-4401-844b-5db08dc9af32-0
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.880
I need to start from my laptop machine.

14ab20ae-8893-4929-9a13-9eef77d02af6-0
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.840
It's like my personal machine.

9c5eba16-4f8d-4f27-a043-101728fc2a0d-0
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

f65c8bcc-3ca3-4e19-a8b0-6bcfd78b231e-0
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.680
So I will go and do my research there.

3888ea69-3208-47ff-8fbb-83cdae5696ef-0
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.080
I just want to copy and paste the test
text to here, that's it.

7d716d0b-cece-41a3-8982-f2f9fe0c853b-0
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:40.004
If I want to read or if there is a small
code is given because in the GitHub they

7d716d0b-cece-41a3-8982-f2f9fe0c853b-1
00:45:40.004 --> 00:45:41.440
give lot more thing.

50ba221c-3fa3-41c7-b9f8-676dec4e48cb-0
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.640
But if you go to that author who did that
one, you have a separate block.

3ad1ccbc-8102-4f0b-949b-320e0b1e37d6-0
00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.760
In that block, I can't read much.

f91496a9-4997-4621-a01e-4cfc5bdc7329-0
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.680
You know, it's blocked.

0be1f934-d972-4e28-8176-168ab573efca-0
00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.160
That's it.

08a06ccf-d869-4961-b7ce-2147f25af23f-0
00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:49.440
Yeah.

ed488804-aded-4ae3-9912-a441a69be64f-0
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:55.257
And are you just getting like the page
that pops up that says this one's blocked

ed488804-aded-4ae3-9912-a441a69be64f-1
00:45:55.257 --> 00:45:58.680
and and then there's like a reclassify
this URL.

1d4b06a3-cb08-4cf4-9cb1-e50f4ed2e7c6-0
00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.040
Do do you get that there's a no no as
well?

c448e515-230c-430c-af3f-82ccad855b09-0
00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:01.880
No, it won't.

a7304702-41fb-4c81-8c60-5752eed61268-0
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.560
Doesn't allow me.

40aa18ef-d325-4d58-89de-1cb3e5d257d8-0
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.240
Yeah, cool, 'cause I've had some as well,
right?

195afaa6-0327-4c20-94e5-f75c003c35fc-0
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.720
Like really obvious ones you should be
able to get to.

94ceb91d-e429-4b0f-b819-e8f51168ffc6-0
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.194
And it's weird,
sometimes I've gone back to them a second

94ceb91d-e429-4b0f-b819-e8f51168ffc6-1
00:46:12.194 --> 00:46:16.160
time 5 minutes later and it's let me in
and others it just won't do it.

a1ad6ee5-98a8-4b47-be27-6c92f202803a-0
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.722
So that we absolutely have VMS and I
think,

a1ad6ee5-98a8-4b47-be27-6c92f202803a-1
00:46:19.722 --> 00:46:22.880
I think they're less blocked than that.

a15c7e28-6509-4927-89e9-6752cc6949ac-0
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.059
Let me think about the best person to
talk to Yeah,

a15c7e28-6509-4927-89e9-6752cc6949ac-1
00:46:30.059 --> 00:46:33.440
I don't want to connect to Ask One Net at
all.

eaf61196-98d8-4f49-9c2f-8241cd9a5814-0
00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.181
I just need in a personal VM which has an
Internet thing,

eaf61196-98d8-4f49-9c2f-8241cd9a5814-1
00:46:37.181 --> 00:46:39.440
but I need to open it from Ask One.

6a57cee4-4b8f-476e-a2cf-2766311c62a9-0
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.560
Yeah.

b8444c18-ace4-4b95-b005-cdfd13424e49-0
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.800
And I so so grant that we keep talking
about who's not here anymore.

e1259ba0-c071-4322-a890-f23801d6781d-0
00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.647
He was our duo guy that could go and find
this information and get the right people

e1259ba0-c071-4322-a890-f23801d6781d-1
00:46:48.647 --> 00:46:50.800
and he'd take it as a back door kind of
thing.

05567f64-2518-42fc-894f-d2991c0becce-0
00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.240
But he's not there anymore, right.

7c46b895-0d2e-40ab-983e-eb7fdbf71174-0
00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.960
So leave it with me.

0b8d9ec4-90ea-4de8-8d2d-16e8b1d2ab53-0
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.320
I will add that to my list and I'll go
and have a chat to find out.

59b6b466-8434-49ae-9ee4-2f0194b28a6b-0
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.920
But the the only reason I'm humming and R
ING there's two reasons.

f3b430bc-6c9c-4b06-acda-4009c7bd7616-0
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:08.040
One is the VM that I got they charge us
for, which wasn't prohibitive either.

f7257ef1-8c19-4de7-aa7b-c1f4b18b04d0-0
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.680
I don't use mine right.

93227f5e-5b24-4c41-b4fc-ca15b190a947-0
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.570
So I'm happy for you to take mine over
and then there's no difference in charge

93227f5e-5b24-4c41-b4fc-ca15b190a947-1
00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:13.960
to ASPA.

ceeca7ed-8adc-4c71-a421-bd4d3f5008e6-0
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.694
But I just don't know if it's
unrestricted enough for you to get access

ceeca7ed-8adc-4c71-a421-bd4d3f5008e6-1
00:47:17.694 --> 00:47:18.760
to what you want right.

cc76d21c-6b1e-4766-9225-3d66a03a25c2-0
00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.346
So I just want to make sure that we cover
those off before we do yeah before we

cc76d21c-6b1e-4766-9225-3d66a03a25c2-1
00:47:22.346 --> 00:47:22.840
give you 1.

2d30d1b8-e2c6-42fa-a9c4-5af973b6a856-0
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.760
I have no, no problem with you having one.

75073e04-168d-4e29-8cb5-ca74f51bfb4d-0
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.440
So.

025e1a14-c4cb-43a3-a5ca-1745e1367dee-0
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.520
So if this is the way to solve the
problem, then we'll get you one.

4de6366e-3c0e-4bc4-8fa2-27e0dcb0c2d5-0
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.329
It would be,
it would be so easy because with the

4de6366e-3c0e-4bc4-8fa2-27e0dcb0c2d5-1
00:47:31.329 --> 00:47:34.541
latest DAA and you know,
with the GitHub and which, Yeah,

4de6366e-3c0e-4bc4-8fa2-27e0dcb0c2d5-2
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:37.200
because it's most of The thing is already
done.

d6498817-857b-4896-8421-abfade21491d-0
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.400
Yeah, Yeah.

f187d32e-c45f-4284-97d9-166780440689-0
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.280
So I just want to take what we we need
for ASCO and we need to modify it.

ea29f93a-a630-412a-904a-ee88a49cd1d5-0
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.740
But you know,
I want to play around juggle between two

ea29f93a-a630-412a-904a-ee88a49cd1d5-1
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.520
machines now.

3dcde8b8-81c0-4be4-9bcd-3ec5afb398e2-0
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.200
Yep, Yep.

ffd7673d-c9ef-45f2-a726-5c3289d727ba-0
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.080
No, I, I,
we can absolutely make this happen, right?

01093ba3-cb61-4860-820a-670c66a3d457-0
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:56.221
It's just I'll add it to my list and I'll
go and do a little bit of investigation

01093ba3-cb61-4860-820a-670c66a3d457-1
00:47:56.221 --> 00:47:58.040
and get us a name to go and talk to.

178165a4-388e-446d-99eb-b6b8e23e5b13-0
00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:03.184
If you want, I can share the architecture,
how we did that for the PMC,

178165a4-388e-446d-99eb-b6b8e23e5b13-1
00:48:03.184 --> 00:48:06.200
how they are giving us with the full
access.

f2c8591f-2573-4605-83f8-ebefc441a22a-0
00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:06.600
Yep.

1c013898-7132-47cc-8b85-26843a7903c8-0
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.840
If you want, I can send the email.

d19529be-3caa-4a2e-9919-23df68f909d3-0
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.160
Separate architecture,
what we built for that.

4c496445-fee2-4dbd-b535-bc0812633c68-0
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:10.760
Yeah.

6723752b-41f1-41d2-8f27-b93781bab45b-0
00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.224
OK, yeah,
let me try and get a name and then maybe

6723752b-41f1-41d2-8f27-b93781bab45b-1
00:48:13.224 --> 00:48:17.186
even if we just have a chat with someone
to find out what the best way to achieve

6723752b-41f1-41d2-8f27-b93781bab45b-2
00:48:17.186 --> 00:48:17.960
what we need is.
