5fbad6f2-3d61-4a3c-bfe1-044e72656f27-0
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:16.519
So I had so as I explained before,
so the current set up that we got is we

5fbad6f2-3d61-4a3c-bfe1-044e72656f27-1
00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:22.680
got B to C per CRM environment 1 to 1.

0bbbff87-a42d-45bc-a71d-51c71af7e1c8-0
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.520
So now what we want to do is we want to
have one too many.

cbeabb5f-314a-4d03-a536-9b5ffcbfe3b3-0
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.320
We, we, we don't want it to.

d7432fcf-b1f6-45cb-85d8-62fd5b8718a7-0
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.200
So going back to this diagram,
so we have B to CB to C is mapped to API

d7432fcf-b1f6-45cb-85d8-62fd5b8718a7-1
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.320
and API mapped to a database that's sort
of 1 to one.

a06af059-1834-4e74-8341-34373abaa986-0
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.806
What we wanted to do is we want to have
multiple dev or multiple test

a06af059-1834-4e74-8341-34373abaa986-1
00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:54.400
environments now, right?

ad9af7d7-f2e9-471c-bd87-1e840ad5ee23-0
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.040
But we're trying to avoid creating
additional resources.

de200494-339b-4cb4-b9db-83af415f4cd9-0
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.840
So what we plan to do is we use the same
B to C environment.

d632cee6-c776-49a0-9e9f-c1da5ad35d72-0
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.720
In B to C you can sort of partition.

b52044df-bfe7-4a56-944f-174e4e680762-0
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:21.720
So remember that the policy that we've
got, so we got policies.

2b9e9673-ccac-4f71-a887-6452f091e366-0
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.480
So all these policies can be partitioned.

28c826bd-83d1-401d-8cb1-1e63c7432c7b-0
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:36.000
Like if you go to policy, for example,
policy has a policy ID here.

01c03437-30d2-4e77-822b-f236679bdf1e-0
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.800
So this is the policy ID.

0a6f469f-3e12-4fac-8bfb-133d1d6328d1-0
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.680
So this the first bit here is it's sort
of like AB to C convention.

60dba60e-ad5b-4ee2-b5cf-02b51e7d7afb-0
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.480
It's the same for everything.

5d1bc55d-eabf-490c-b2a6-64b8e0b73a04-0
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.040
So you can't really rename it.

7a55aea4-1b0b-4e0e-9282-9b7c2b101cd6-0
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.680
And what you can name is what's after.

3444d2a1-d2a1-47f0-8abd-32c16081efc6-0
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.554
So what we're planning to do is if the
environment is partitioned,

3444d2a1-d2a1-47f0-8abd-32c16081efc6-1
00:02:04.554 --> 00:02:10.867
so when the policy is deployed,
we're going to put the environment name

3444d2a1-d2a1-47f0-8abd-32c16081efc6-2
00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:11.920
as a prefix.

c176e6c6-82bf-4560-91b2-48ace197c66d-0
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.560
So in a single BTC environment.

3a7ee3e7-c11b-4d39-9020-1723888e58c4-0
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.600
So we'll have dev.

c4729cfa-89be-42a1-b592-6350b5068b4f-0
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.555
So if we reuse dev B to C for dev in test
verse,

c4729cfa-89be-42a1-b592-6350b5068b4f-1
00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:30.880
so then we'll have dev this B to C policy
and they will have the same policy for

c4729cfa-89be-42a1-b592-6350b5068b4f-2
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.600
dev in.

692de265-722a-4f2a-94c8-7fd97f78ec3c-0
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.800
So during deployment,
we can deploy to those sort of like their

692de265-722a-4f2a-94c8-7fd97f78ec3c-1
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.680
partition and dev in partition.

34290ad0-0407-4a5c-9e5c-40536e572d40-0
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.160
They're not really physical partitions,
they're just logical partitions by name.

436191a7-456e-4901-8695-905c0ee6ccc3-0
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.620
So we'll have in dev tenant,
we'll have a bunch of dev prefixed

436191a7-456e-4901-8695-905c0ee6ccc3-1
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.680
policies and then we'll have a bunch of
dev in prefix policies.

a1b990b2-1ffe-40e5-8b7f-bbcdcbacc805-0
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.600
So, so in, in, in the portal.

54c68d82-07b0-49c7-bfb8-adc5a1931d9d-0
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.261
So,
so we have a dev portal and we have dev

54c68d82-07b0-49c7-bfb8-adc5a1931d9d-1
00:03:03.261 --> 00:03:04.120
in portal, right?

b3cdb866-3f4f-4f3d-9a9c-7118ee30d6f7-0
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:14.534
So when we configure the BTC provider,
so we need to to use the prefixed policy

b3cdb866-3f4f-4f3d-9a9c-7118ee30d6f7-1
00:03:14.534 --> 00:03:23.000
names so the each portal can browse to
the its correspondent policy.

6a0ec347-b517-4e6a-9d2b-9e742ac5084c-0
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.720
So how do you configure that, Tanuka?

0d12454c-264b-4a13-bc1f-cf1fd782f749-0
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.640
Like for dev, this is the prefix,
for Devin, this is the prefix.

c823c7c1-5f68-492e-8801-948e5210acfe-0
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.800
How do you configure that?

31d4b05a-64cd-497c-9800-898e4540c3eb-0
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.560
Yeah, so, so I've done so that you coming?

7b961954-22b7-4819-a507-feb342777dee-0
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.960
OK, Yeah.

f3c945b1-06f9-40bc-939f-ef64d457323f-0
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.880
So let's go through the changes I've made,
right?

3f15b705-cb97-4587-b53d-857c54d0e6a0-0
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.920
Let's go to Azure Dev OPS.

d814d023-a0e3-435d-8621-c0b07ae81480-0
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.080
Another question also like so you showed
me that policy, right?

222a4651-665c-4c2d-8475-cca88a757654-0
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.840
You can put the logical partitioning
there.

9d39ecf3-8c14-49b4-b2b6-3e041ccab1cb-0
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.702
So when you when you have those sections
shown on that policy,

9d39ecf3-8c14-49b4-b2b6-3e041ccab1cb-1
00:03:58.702 --> 00:04:02.770
you will have like a different section
for a different environment in the

9d39ecf3-8c14-49b4-b2b6-3e041ccab1cb-2
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.320
partition.

43b8c5fa-30e9-4636-874b-cc0ef921a739-0
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.517
Is it or how do you how do you put the
partition in inside the policy or where

43b8c5fa-30e9-4636-874b-cc0ef921a739-1
00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:10.360
do you place this partition?

01401a06-2036-4240-add8-77d1ef26fdd5-0
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.800
Partition is not inside the policy.

1c8257c8-145b-4e2c-be51-ac70b851f41b-0
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.840
OK Policy is the partition OK?

9303e46a-7ee8-4b68-abf5-186ea7222135-0
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.520
So so maybe it's easier to it's easier to
show.

1df9d493-d570-4e0f-94ce-12185c774342-0
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.080
So if I go to.

9cd76ebe-ddb5-4fa2-88f4-704f6f9907a9-0
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.440
So if I go to dev, let me switch to dev.

5a755dac-4ebf-447b-981d-8393c4c266d1-0
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:38.164
So if I go to policies,
so you can see there are sets of policies

5a755dac-4ebf-447b-981d-8393c4c266d1-1
00:05:38.164 --> 00:05:47.440
they went and there are dev policies,
right?

11e2511b-3abc-41f5-b076-126962fdf87a-0
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.400
Yeah.

1754aa32-48e1-4fef-b7e0-292bbf9de6c8-0
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:56.040
So the policy content is the same, OK,
But the policy configuration is different.

acdcfb9a-259c-4692-bb3b-ae624cf7fc07-0
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.800
So remember that in the in, in here, Yeah.

695b219e-4d90-48d4-8e9a-b7390dc63b42-0
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.200
So in policies we have placeholders for
configuration, right?

1a7847bf-c08a-438e-919d-46faebc88822-0
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.800
Yeah.

57fa99b8-80e8-441e-873d-4d074f387a7f-0
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.360
And now you can see now there's dev
configuration, yeah.

ed0b7bfb-85ff-4c2a-acb9-512e9cb10633-0
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.200
And there's dev in configuration.

7544a81d-f4c4-4a95-a032-fd2ae21ac373-0
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.250
So what it will do is it'll get the
policy,

7544a81d-f4c4-4a95-a032-fd2ae21ac373-1
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:28.040
get the configuration and replace the
policy with the configuration, right?

513504dc-e4a0-4efc-91fb-f97f11ee02c4-0
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.160
And deploy to the correct partition.

2bf557fe-e05b-483a-9460-44df3ca03767-0
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.480
So partition is just by convention, right?

638ea768-bb9d-4a6c-b4b5-56813647bacb-0
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.400
Just by name.

eaea2f14-ed40-4cd7-8252-efcdf09e5326-0
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.360
So it's not really a real partition.

d101d602-9744-4072-97df-258a52316f8c-0
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.880
So you can have trusted framework base.

99adf786-e35d-44f3-9166-ceb7dff65717-0
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.216
Yeah, for dev,
you can have trusted framework for dev

99adf786-e35d-44f3-9166-ceb7dff65717-1
00:06:49.216 --> 00:06:51.480
int you can have two different versions.

32dce2e8-cee9-4a7b-98f6-4f7de0e26085-0
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.400
OK, right.

f841831a-cb37-4f4f-8808-e865d7eb2134-0
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.109
So these are not like physical policy,
which is there,

f841831a-cb37-4f4f-8808-e865d7eb2134-1
00:06:58.109 --> 00:07:01.280
but you're just like configuring for this
one.

a59dfd50-30f9-479f-a68a-cf694ac576bc-0
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.493
Just yeah,
replace those placeholders with the devs

a59dfd50-30f9-479f-a68a-cf694ac576bc-1
00:07:04.493 --> 00:07:09.622
int like kind of variable and then put it
and then replace it and deploy something

a59dfd50-30f9-479f-a68a-cf694ac576bc-2
00:07:09.622 --> 00:07:10.240
like that.

b85b8e9d-adc0-4f7b-b03f-3d0ee1d2c2e8-0
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.480
OK, that's correct.

18fa21e6-de23-4c7a-9ee6-989f30f9fd34-0
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.520
That's correct.

f86a8083-abda-455c-9478-7adc0694cdb1-0
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.280
OK, yeah.

3cca7d49-c54c-4c21-b1fc-48205a62997c-0
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.400
So let's look at the changes I've made.

ee4e8bd7-68d7-4724-9248-e8ae80423451-0
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:33.240
So we checking everything and we use the
concept of pull request.

83e89dc3-2fef-404c-aa1f-0d638a571bdb-0
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:39.800
Pull request is, so you give the,
you get someone to review the changes.

d83395f4-5873-4b91-bf5e-ff49429e17d7-0
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.600
So now you can see these are changes to
support the dev int.

5321a877-3c10-4934-a4f2-a8b73ff98718-0
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.400
Yeah.

d7efdcf1-b2e4-47a7-a4ea-22dbb7eab743-0
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.011
But if you if you for example,
you don't need to make this many changes

d7efdcf1-b2e4-47a7-a4ea-22dbb7eab743-1
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:01.928
if you're doing another partition
environment because the partitions were

d7efdcf1-b2e4-47a7-a4ea-22dbb7eab743-2
00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:03.040
not supported before.

5e8a1098-ce52-4674-9e88-297de4db5b48-0
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.948
So all you need to do is you need to tell
the environment is partitioned in the

5e8a1098-ce52-4674-9e88-297de4db5b48-1
00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:11.480
config.

e7587e79-c070-446e-80c3-f984f14f5dce-0
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.920
Yep, Right.

6aae7b39-7d8e-4eab-8a8d-0ca8b712fddb-0
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.160
And so I've created a new dev in config,
Yeah, which is also partitioned.

151a27b4-acc1-43b8-bf83-5f65934e5b7a-0
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.680
So these two are partitioned.

5d285f13-94b1-4fff-b568-08ace1aca878-0
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.280
And so it's gonna go to the same tenant
as dev.

be437bd7-4b93-488f-b9a1-ddefbef64530-0
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:26.400
Yep.

5c49ca1f-ac08-4561-a39d-8c830908a243-0
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.760
And it's gonna use all the settings
pretty much as the same.

b6533959-1717-4335-9d27-3dc65e09904c-0
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.360
Yeah, right.

f219257e-4278-4084-8914-e4c1ad3373cb-0
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:42.920
But the difference is it's going to use
the dev int API, OK, right.

c7070cab-2924-4c22-9976-ff129673181e-0
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:49.736
So so here dev policies will talk to dev
API,

c7070cab-2924-4c22-9976-ff129673181e-1
00:08:49.736 --> 00:08:55.960
Dev int policies will talk to dev int API.

d5c6fa6e-e0f1-4d81-8c39-83b0cb7e614c-0
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.280
Yep.

f2540472-7f63-43a1-9a3a-d50f98352295-0
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.160
Right.

af937685-eaf0-4675-8ce4-960ab1d11741-0
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.401
And dev API is connected to dev database,
Dev int API is connected to dev int

af937685-eaf0-4675-8ce4-960ab1d11741-1
00:09:03.401 --> 00:09:04.080
database.

8d117e7e-7a36-454d-92eb-cabe0b7f4a23-0
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:04.280
Yep.

446953eb-203c-4ca7-ade5-e14f5dfc312c-0
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.626
So you, so you,
so you pretty much have A have two

446953eb-203c-4ca7-ade5-e14f5dfc312c-1
00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:14.600
environments in single B to C logically
partitioned.

41567dbc-7d1a-4245-82f8-321b604c1001-0
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.413
I mean, yeah,
when you leave B to C they're physically

41567dbc-7d1a-4245-82f8-321b604c1001-1
00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:20.280
partitioned.

d16a68e5-2944-42f9-a1b6-3ac814da801e-0
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:26.760
But within B to C they're logically
partitioned, yes.

0aeedf63-70be-4a87-ab0c-11d9cb6cbda9-0
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.090
So for each of the environment,
you will have a resource group in B to C,

0aeedf63-70be-4a87-ab0c-11d9cb6cbda9-1
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:30.360
right.

036e921a-0405-410d-a8e1-7781c92cd796-0
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.828
For dev alone,
you're not putting a separate resource

036e921a-0405-410d-a8e1-7781c92cd796-1
00:09:33.828 --> 00:09:34.120
group.

f91df4ac-8caf-4bb0-bd32-0074a41ff6d0-0
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.920
You're partitioning into dev and dev int.

c2292782-c1a9-4648-89e7-0dc963e9c3d8-0
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.640
Yeah, so, so in in dev.

64964c9b-9a2c-4032-8e44-998dcdafc79e-0
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.800
So we have we have everything dev, right?

0f72360e-84b7-4071-9841-dec364f391af-0
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.560
And we have additional dev int API.

9248d65a-f2dc-4f75-8356-890d11d53b7e-0
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.428
OK, so, so dev and dev int API,
they both uses the same keyboard and uses

9248d65a-f2dc-4f75-8356-890d11d53b7e-1
00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:58.600
the same application inside for logging.

ce0dd13a-87af-41d5-a3a6-6ce5ef7716d1-0
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

bdca02d9-981b-47bb-9b1a-120e58bd9dd3-0
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.999
So,
so this is the signing bit I explained

bdca02d9-981b-47bb-9b1a-120e58bd9dd3-1
00:10:10.999 --> 00:10:17.520
before any PowerShell changes requires
signature change.

87d8de00-a6dd-42c2-827a-8aecde22698d-0
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.040
So this is the partitioning
implementation.

059f2cae-399d-4290-bc08-084acd048f0b-0
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.360
I don't think you'll need to go into the
details of it.

c5b3a4f2-9678-4b5c-a67d-95b1e85b3496-0
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:34.950
It's just read the values and append the
so you can see the policy ID get appended

c5b3a4f2-9678-4b5c-a67d-95b1e85b3496-1
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.000
with the environment name to partition
them.

78b5826e-dc2f-49ed-9fcd-a348b0d2f774-0
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:45.708
That's that's pretty much the logic to
get the policies and read the

78b5826e-dc2f-49ed-9fcd-a348b0d2f774-1
00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:53.255
corresponding configuration and rename
the policy to prefix the environment and

78b5826e-dc2f-49ed-9fcd-a348b0d2f774-2
00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:56.840
and and and replace the configuration.

4ea538bc-fb94-4a8d-8474-9d713760fccc-0
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.040
So pipeline also need to change.

e1944bcf-6475-4bcc-bd8b-61acee06d29f-0
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.501
So now if you go,
so I haven't shown you the pipelines yet,

e1944bcf-6475-4bcc-bd8b-61acee06d29f-1
00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:08.880
right.

925ffc33-4852-4c1d-afe5-e30d5d39f3f7-0
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:17.320
If I go to the pipelines,
so there are two pipelines,

925ffc33-4852-4c1d-afe5-e30d5d39f3f7-1
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:28.119
1 is for B to C policy deployments,
the other one is for the identity API

925ffc33-4852-4c1d-afe5-e30d5d39f3f7-2
00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:30.600
deployment right?

d3571e7a-8aea-496e-9a06-0355b01172c9-0
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.000
So if you go to the so this is the
partition environment, the branch.

d309f9c1-6183-404f-849a-4e70a009e025-0
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.560
So this is how it get deployed right?

b7ea42d6-bce9-4e41-8995-1a04b2a1ec8d-0
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:45.360
So the policies get built and get
deployed to dev.

4dec6951-42ab-424a-8a91-27bfe21db326-0
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:58.520
After dev you can deploy to dev or test
and then from there onwards pre prod.

9a4cd4f2-8328-4494-82ed-a69d02ad7435-0
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:05.060
So I haven't hooked up pre prod yet but
when you guys are ready because I

9a4cd4f2-8328-4494-82ed-a69d02ad7435-1
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:11.826
intentionally didn't connect dev into pre
port prod because RMS stuff for months

9a4cd4f2-8328-4494-82ed-a69d02ad7435-2
00:12:11.826 --> 00:12:15.000
now I'm going to go to pre prod right?

fabdc81e-921f-4604-8246-06907bfe022a-0
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.860
Just going to stay in devint I believe,
but the other branch you can take it to

fabdc81e-921f-4604-8246-06907bfe022a-1
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:29.640
pre prod if you want to make production
changes all the way to prod.

028f56cd-1e9b-4226-b2ab-c59c889dd4a3-0
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.480
The same exists for the APIAPI.

6c69ddbc-77ee-4e91-9b64-67b88ecafa9a-0
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:48.440
Similar, yeah, the event test likewise.

c384b338-543a-479c-a07e-d91135afe6ad-0
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.160
So you DevOps also have this concept of
environment.

b6e34191-ec8a-452d-9e6b-7307b8f38a03-0
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:59.802
So environments you can put you can
control security who can deploy to

b6e34191-ec8a-452d-9e6b-7307b8f38a03-1
00:12:59.802 --> 00:13:00.960
environments.

d93c9d96-c0cd-4f46-9112-de2dc6612a1e-0
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.440
So normally dev and above.

12689837-71ad-42be-80bf-259cac903366-0
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.240
So we've set approvers who need to
approve the deployment.

6c3396d6-29e3-49a6-9e39-4e25c7fe679e-0
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.480
So not not everyone can deploy to those
environments.

336aff15-92fd-4662-a3f8-745ea36c1401-0
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.880
So I think I disabled this.

327823e3-61fd-4161-b86f-fa04e6480318-0
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.040
I'll enable it.

94cf0a34-1718-45a1-92a3-e26330c36bb0-0
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:25.120
So Pradeep is on all the environment
approval checklists?

513f7211-2588-4b5f-a4c3-7c03fcd57005-0
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.520
Yes.

ab00caad-c4eb-4c92-920b-d1e3484ac37d-0
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:32.273
So if you want to get something deployed
to test or pre prod,

ab00caad-c4eb-4c92-920b-d1e3484ac37d-1
00:13:32.273 --> 00:13:35.800
pre prod this check who's on pre prod.

77f0c3bc-9e7e-4740-8cfb-8307cbf080f2-0
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:42.316
Yeah,
Jamie and Pradeep prod I think again,

77f0c3bc-9e7e-4740-8cfb-8307cbf080f2-1
00:13:42.316 --> 00:13:52.240
Jamie and Pradeep, Pradeep test,
I think because we, I think test.

bd58cfca-9340-4c84-af89-c3405d10e03e-0
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.560
I had Amit in there because Amit was the
test.

468de526-0cc5-4102-9a36-f148a68bbf56-0
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.400
We don't want to.

dcc82193-b499-44d2-81fa-669f1a9bd48e-0
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.720
Yeah, Deep is in there, so he can.

db22ca40-4475-474e-8d64-8b63a7827987-0
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.360
If you want to change it later on, we can.

828848f5-71c4-4f34-962f-22ef7072dda8-0
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.240
We can change it.

f4519b98-638e-4083-b4a7-52b0f5d9d896-0
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:17.840
So what we'll do is will merge this pull
request.

36e0e91b-ba41-4902-958c-d300228b27b7-0
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.508
So what what will happen is once you
merge this pull request,

36e0e91b-ba41-4902-958c-d300228b27b7-1
00:14:23.508 --> 00:14:29.277
the build get run and it will get
deployed to its corresponding

36e0e91b-ba41-4902-958c-d300228b27b7-2
00:14:29.277 --> 00:14:31.080
environments, right.

ee2bd286-0efc-4c7f-8abe-4271175b1b4c-0
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.400
Let's complete squash.

1ea23807-8f92-40a9-9e27-6b8223f5fb67-0
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.920
Yeah, so it's now merged.

9b479632-3d12-4dfe-8348-129576b10c74-0
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.280
You should see the builds got kicked off.

bf791715-3d9b-45da-af16-642d08fbb224-0
00:14:52.400 --> 00:15:00.480
So now I'll start deploying the partition
stuff into different environments.

d258199b-50ce-471d-9f1f-4ca2faab898e-0
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.120
So meanwhile it'll take a little while to
deploy.

05084eed-a519-4314-813a-59758807dafa-0
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:21.880
So I already deployed the API partition
API to to Devint Devint API.

16198ce1-e2d9-486d-bd1c-7bef9f057fbf-0
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.822
So for example,
if you go to the Devint API,

16198ce1-e2d9-486d-bd1c-7bef9f057fbf-1
00:15:27.822 --> 00:15:31.920
so you have the Azure default DNS.

8edf06aa-dbff-48cf-b86c-ba1463f85000-0
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:39.960
So this DNS cannot be accessed outside of
ASCO network.

7d48e66c-72e0-4c17-8e57-fccbfea87f0a-0
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:46.785
So that's why we need a gateway change to
get the request through the gateway into

7d48e66c-72e0-4c17-8e57-fccbfea87f0a-1
00:15:46.785 --> 00:15:50.640
the ASCO network and to the app service,
right?

7325eba8-698f-44a6-a65a-a7dfb415716b-0
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.680
So that part is pending.

1d81d2fe-36b6-4495-bacc-9602a343d137-0
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.925
So, so we've,
we've raised change requests to be

1d81d2fe-36b6-4495-bacc-9602a343d137-1
00:15:57.925 --> 00:16:00.280
actioned on Wednesday.

094e498e-9add-4757-a605-4b82a95e7391-0
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.240
So hopefully we'll get the DNS.

25cd13ec-d472-415b-a533-f0534ff302f2-0
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:08.400
So it'll be like DEVINT dot API dot asco.
gov dot AU.

e5bea65d-d4ef-4972-9500-70a018a4906d-0
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.520
So currently we got that right.

e05feeb8-ec29-4c27-88eb-548afc6cdb9b-0
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.600
So let's maybe try.

1107d49d-04b2-4e11-9b16-8dec067e0428-0
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.560
So so dev is like this, right?

595af5cf-6cbe-4d5c-b1bd-16af0cbd51d9-0
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:34.200
Like that, yeah, for for example,
this is test, right?

fb3d6a6b-504f-4b1f-89ac-6197eb723b05-0
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:40.320
So this is the proper DNS for test dev is
like this, right?

af855126-002f-43a5-946f-9c8e02fd4c73-0
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:49.160
Because we don't have we don't have the
full DNS set it up yet.

32781863-27a4-47e3-a446-eb26b02c3712-0
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.680
So we'll just try to use the ask for DNS.

05de654a-5781-40d1-8efc-0dd936f46bd2-0
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:58.380
Sorry,
the Azure DNS we which we can hit it from

05de654a-5781-40d1-8efc-0dd936f46bd2-1
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.480
our machine because we are VPN.

bc1e3cd1-c555-42bf-9035-c236b80dce29-0
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:12.440
So for example, let's go, let's try this.

5d275afc-680f-43d0-bfb6-61d241430050-0
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.600
So you can see the API return for O1.

89380de6-c7ba-4b9f-8df3-77b1ba3f534d-0
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:35.640
So the reason being so the access so API
requires access token to be accessed.

b4572af9-2f5c-4438-970f-9907a291a9ee-0
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:48.080
So this access token is expired,
so we need to get a new access token so.

5e67deb0-e15b-42d8-a87b-5dbcf08f2826-0
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:59.451
So I'm using the same credentials as B to
C when you said you need that DNS enabled,

5e67deb0-e15b-42d8-a87b-5dbcf08f2826-1
00:17:59.451 --> 00:18:00.240
right?

4074e2b9-60fd-4301-9f46-1a4734aa4fc3-0
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.120
The change request is not yet done right
Will it allow when you hit the endpoint?

f4acf6c3-5e94-4f94-886b-32cce909bcce-0
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:10.640
Yeah, because we it, it will,
because we are trying to access from VPN.

756ef7ec-9ea6-4400-bc06-28fb61a92576-0
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.760
All right, OK.

70eb81a9-30be-4109-b2c4-091c58675636-0
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.880
But it won't work from B to C external
network.

99e7b14f-f21d-44b9-9a87-09a241372289-0
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.385
Yeah,
external network B to C is in external

99e7b14f-f21d-44b9-9a87-09a241372289-1
00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:16.760
network.

b9071666-ab61-47d3-8d35-d14bd9d29e40-0
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:23.040
So B to C won't be able to hit the event
yet until they get the requests are made.

e2c7ecb2-1c71-4fe2-93e1-ccba396dc426-0
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.400
But the postman can because postman runs
in a machine and yeah, yeah, yeah, got it.

9ec673b8-f74c-445f-8c6f-4aabaf1cacbd-0
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.640
Route the request through the VPN.

56a54525-407b-4ab8-aba8-1c419154e98a-0
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.360
So we need to get access token.

b2bfa22e-123a-43e7-9b3e-d5253a0822c1-0
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.737
I'll get the access token,
access token I'm using the same the

b2bfa22e-123a-43e7-9b3e-d5253a0822c1-1
00:18:39.737 --> 00:18:45.200
credentials to connect to B to CI showed
you guys before right?

0815a85e-5c1f-4518-8f25-f26a9efc0d79-0
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.120
So it's in keyboard so you can get the
these settings.

22d211ad-4b0e-4d88-b8d7-842da347b09a-0
00:18:49.400 --> 00:19:00.291
So I've created the Postman collection so
I can I can export it and give it to you

22d211ad-4b0e-4d88-b8d7-842da347b09a-1
00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:04.360
guys, then you guys can use it.

38767bb2-d937-4e4b-b7b9-a813b793017c-0
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:13.623
So for example, if I get a token,
So if you when you get a token,

38767bb2-d937-4e4b-b7b9-a813b793017c-1
00:19:13.623 --> 00:19:18.118
if you're having any issues with the
token,

38767bb2-d937-4e4b-b7b9-a813b793017c-2
00:19:18.118 --> 00:19:23.840
if you want to see what's in this token,
you can go to.

41c2abe4-761f-4139-ab08-070192be6770-0
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.240
There's a website called Ms.

d4e4ee17-d28c-47ec-8424-cb086409e1ad-0
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:42.699
Or you can go to JWT dot IOOJWT dot Ms
you can see this,

d4e4ee17-d28c-47ec-8424-cb086409e1ad-1
00:19:42.699 --> 00:19:48.440
you can see this what this token is for.

6f14309c-c6e2-46b2-b7fc-3aeb410715f7-0
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.480
And I think the important thing is you
can see the expiry date,

6f14309c-c6e2-46b2-b7fc-3aeb410715f7-1
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.200
so this is in epoch time.

8e4f2eb8-92c8-455f-aa35-bbc60e88b86c-0
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.400
So you can convert the.

24a5db7b-9a72-4869-bad7-c2f056b74d7f-0
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:13.280
You go to UTC time, so you can.

d71f92ef-5136-4907-ab2e-009b936b9831-0
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:21.120
Yeah, you can see the timestamp.

7adb90bc-de7c-43fc-b61e-9b2feec3bc18-0
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:27.440
This is the UTC timestamp when that token
is going to expire anyway.

0befc475-119b-4a3c-b25a-01dd9248fde9-0
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.720
So we've got the token.

a1478cc5-15a9-4074-88d5-2e0564ec891a-0
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:42.740
We're going to use the token to hit the
DEVINT for each transaction.

fdabf7b4-632d-4e0d-942b-94dc6e76d6c6-0
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.620
The token varies.

6d9f94ab-d1ad-4f84-946f-6ef5c59ef224-0
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:43.940
Is it?

315f4ad2-29c4-454f-a8d5-bdfac57f760e-0
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.043
No, No,
because it's a it's a application token,

315f4ad2-29c4-454f-a8d5-bdfac57f760e-1
00:20:49.043 --> 00:20:49.580
right?

bb48c1bc-1804-442b-b9b4-fd9e3d9ecf8f-0
00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.860
So it's not a user token.

91c62951-ceb9-4fb3-b0c7-bcce70d37776-0
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.900
OK, so it's a app registration token.

c07435f8-490b-4c20-a09d-78afdf1aa270-0
00:20:53.900 --> 00:21:01.380
So it will keep the token in the cache
until it expires.

90e31fb6-4dc9-4ed1-a9e8-d70d1870abea-0
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.620
Once it expires, it will renew the token.

ab5633e3-9aa9-4415-a90a-9155804c97b0-0
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.760
Do you know what's the validity of that
token?

2fa123e8-9fe3-449f-b5f8-a6d0ec506344-0
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.240
Like how long, how often does it expire?

9685dce5-a48e-4a1e-9f5f-43bcf5ca31bb-0
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.640
So you can, you can figure it out here,
right.

c953a3c8-4562-40c2-aaca-6162c03ca705-0
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.640
So you can look at the expiry.

43fa4961-7213-40a8-89a5-505df930e9f5-0
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.400
OK, OK.

02cb7748-4787-4b63-9e28-35b726e45b2f-0
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.560
That's expiry issue.

6f1165dc-bcd3-4ca8-a503-e09b6c3de94f-0
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.240
This is the issue at and this is expiring.

db9879a4-3751-47d1-ae50-9e629020e74c-0
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.800
So you can figure it out.

39544b1b-39cc-49ff-ab21-fe7a8a54d96a-0
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.697
Yeah,
I think it's probably half an hour or

39544b1b-39cc-49ff-ab21-fe7a8a54d96a-1
00:21:27.697 --> 00:21:28.120
something.

64a6df48-c94c-444b-a44c-495a570363fd-0
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.240
But you can verify that by comparing
these two epoch times.

cc3e9f78-21f7-4f54-b6e3-c1f4ce0e069f-0
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:34.920
Yeah, let's.

ca8e77a9-ce5f-43cd-9263-136d81250c36-0
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.600
What's the token?

957a53e4-f28d-408f-94a4-e02f48660da4-0
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.960
The right session copy.

3f24f40f-e48a-4da7-a0a3-b7a1e39821d1-0
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.680
Like it's doing something.

6005637b-bf6d-49fb-be27-54ffe89bce70-0
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.720
Yeah, it returned the response.

74e8313a-8056-499f-aa26-9b2a484352f9-0
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.800
Where is the body?

03e3e552-23a7-4fe7-968c-179ba18e1f4e-0
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.120
Yeah.

6c32b6bc-baf8-40db-a387-46f7f92c3992-0
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.240
So, so I put this ARN.

a581c0c8-f4ec-4b68-b4fe-8152e9b9ad70-0
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.040
Devin doesn't have this ARN,
so it returned there.

1249e341-0798-4aad-802b-54a500317760-0
00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.320
There is no matching.

269a9b09-8361-47a6-bdef-a51e372e5cb3-0
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.440
Ask a reference number and date of birth
so we can validate that.

0e75e19b-0405-435b-a885-bb59a3c38d15-0
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:56.312
So we can go to,
we can go to dev and so we can go to the

0e75e19b-0405-435b-a885-bb59a3c38d15-1
00:22:56.312 --> 00:23:07.440
application inside and see what did it
actually work.

f6cdafd4-c6d7-4c93-9764-cad22707cd73-0
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.040
Yeah.

9f70298f-f89f-454d-8251-9979f538f1db-0
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.080
So this is the first four O 1,
so you can see.

4d9099e8-162a-4f72-a7e8-8dbf507a3aeb-0
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.982
So if you go look at this,
so you can see it's a four O 1

4d9099e8-162a-4f72-a7e8-8dbf507a3aeb-1
00:23:33.982 --> 00:23:36.120
authentication field.

56a6c119-be39-44bf-b278-966036bf37f8-0
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:47.814
But so if you go to this now that's the
four O 1,

56a6c119-be39-44bf-b278-966036bf37f8-1
00:23:47.814 --> 00:23:57.040
it takes few minutes for for it to come
through.

d1113abf-60e7-458f-ab6c-d9c00b72d0ef-0
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.750
While we're waiting,
let's see what happened with the pipeline.

b700bb5f-5501-4ac0-8566-dafa344e755b-0
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:26.779
OK,
so pipeline it's failing to be deployed

b700bb5f-5501-4ac0-8566-dafa344e755b-1
00:24:26.779 --> 00:24:28.790
to event.

d839a036-f9f9-4b81-9444-c9c1682c48ec-0
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.550
I should be able to.

4c8ef3b4-ba7a-4c06-8583-edee5d83debe-0
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.120
Is Pradeep there because I can't approve
my own?

2b49dbc2-62ce-4d14-bf04-d70678ce61d7-0
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.040
Yes, yeah.

d770f73c-9560-4bb1-9f97-0801006285e5-0
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.240
Is Pradeep in there in the meeting?

a30786f3-b6bd-4aab-8719-af0a030f9c4e-0
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:52.920
Yeah, Yeah.

38997d21-c0a1-4bfc-a45b-50ac1cd1ef54-0
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.880
Pradeep,
could you approve these pipelines please?

fbdc4840-e623-4cba-b918-182d4c1569b9-0
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.640
Just just for the event environment for
both the pipelines.

90b69e46-0561-41a5-975a-05f58fea3b9e-0
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.160
So let's go back while it's been approved,
let's go back in here.

44650bf9-7d3f-448c-8f45-e8fb553b0a96-0
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:50.183
OK,
so verify 400 so you can see the DEVINT

44650bf9-7d3f-448c-8f45-e8fb553b0a96-1
00:25:50.183 --> 00:25:56.280
API is calling the DEVINT database.

5cb90e5a-532c-49f8-937a-c5719b730996-0
00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.068
So it's it's all looking good,
no connection issues,

5cb90e5a-532c-49f8-937a-c5719b730996-1
00:26:02.068 --> 00:26:07.080
but it didn't verify because the data
didn't match.

909847f2-e5a6-4ef7-9f96-d721194680b3-0
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.280
So is it because the data didn't match it
is showing as red?

9a61fcac-f50c-4963-a8f4-2956ef35e167-0
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.600
Yeah, because it it's error.

7651a7cb-3bbc-4390-85b7-b315b7e55b73-0
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.927
So oh, OK,
because ARN didn't match API return error

7651a7cb-3bbc-4390-85b7-b315b7e55b73-1
00:26:21.927 --> 00:26:22.920
response 400.

f40ffddd-6e8f-4132-92d2-45ccc76523e0-0
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.400
So that's what we saw here.

9c324469-acf6-4317-a84c-9c4972860bb0-0
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.760
OK, if you go to, if you go to dev end.

350c9c5c-4aa2-4938-adbd-aa1a4d9568fe-0
00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:04.465
I go to the event and if I find the ARN
that matches tables,

350c9c5c-4aa2-4938-adbd-aa1a4d9568fe-1
00:27:04.465 --> 00:27:11.220
I hope David environment have some ARN.

c7dbbe40-5c56-4d51-bddc-b8582bf26e24-0
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.920
I need to find something with date of
birth as well.

00262ca5-8368-4347-8190-abb59efd2303-0
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.290
Yeah, it doesn't have any errands yet.

b0a245ba-edf0-4cad-be2a-2cc6e8d409a7-0
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.090
So this 400 error, right?

60e1b52d-b988-407e-a226-c3916cdb71fc-0
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.490
Is it being configured like when you're
executing an API, right?

f1dc991b-5c51-48c8-b660-e1b8e3f51f4a-0
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.558
It has gone to CRM,
it has hit the database,

f1dc991b-5c51-48c8-b660-e1b8e3f51f4a-1
00:27:43.558 --> 00:27:47.650
the query does not respond like it
doesn't return any result, right?

5aadd982-75a1-40e0-b820-88de95fed897-0
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:52.040
But this transaction is successful there
Yes, it has gone it has queried.

0cc195fc-6b2a-423c-b39a-9a4eb92d418a-0
00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.640
But why it is returning 400?

76ead54b-24a2-4813-868b-b41a2b836e83-0
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:59.168
It is like do you customise it or it is
Azure API behaviour to return that if it

76ead54b-24a2-4813-868b-b41a2b836e83-1
00:27:59.168 --> 00:28:01.080
is not there like 400 error.

99b663c5-4e0e-41e3-96f8-7ac7dd8141e8-0
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.000
Let's have a look at the verify code
right.

6d26b2fb-2cf4-4c90-bfcc-b849dcbdb7fb-0
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.135
So,
so this is the code base so impacted

6d26b2fb-2cf4-4c90-bfcc-b849dcbdb7fb-1
00:28:08.135 --> 00:28:12.520
individual controller yeah, verify.

b797e829-8e71-44ff-9ade-18aacf96ed50-0
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:24.966
So the first thing is it cheques whether
the incoming request has correct ARN and

b797e829-8e71-44ff-9ade-18aacf96ed50-1
00:28:24.966 --> 00:28:29.680
a date of birth both are provided.

1836d76f-d115-4af9-a4b5-4ec948468215-0
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:30.400
So.

b9cb97ce-7fda-4467-9f91-ca4ebaa24939-0
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:37.080
So if if I go into this verify method so
it does bunch of cheques, right?

1db27ca8-7516-46b9-90cf-45cbc9b53b82-0
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:44.920
So first it try to call this method and
call database and try to find ARN.

0a9d4663-3b7c-4dbc-858f-c52cff99e783-0
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.760
Yeah, So ARN has what do you guys call it?

534707d3-23b6-4e5f-be8a-9402ef53b422-0
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.360
Related entity, right?

c3cff095-ec3e-48d9-97e9-be350e1d1840-0
00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:57.640
So a contact is related entity to ARN,
right?

6f4955a8-ea51-47f2-9324-def4faaf0b1a-0
00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.182
So,
so it gets the contact and if the contact

6f4955a8-ea51-47f2-9324-def4faaf0b1a-1
00:29:02.182 --> 00:29:05.000
is now, then it returns this error.

89308c8b-565f-4d94-aeb3-724841d6e3ee-0
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.388
So,
So what we're seeing here is we've

89308c8b-565f-4d94-aeb3-724841d6e3ee-1
00:29:08.388 --> 00:29:11.760
provided ARN and we went to Devin
database.

c297f791-1eda-4e99-bb04-a24304aaa1d2-0
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.320
Yeah, but it can't find it.

d424f41b-943a-47e8-a16f-50a72e02f10e-0
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.880
So it returns this error.

65b392ce-3bd9-4834-b018-3cf027815e13-0
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.920
That's that's what happening in that
instance.

7830398f-35fd-44a7-8535-901eebd55554-0
00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:33.375
And then the next check is it cheques the
date of birth provided matches with the

7830398f-35fd-44a7-8535-901eebd55554-1
00:29:33.375 --> 00:29:36.600
contacts date of birth, right.

281c2c61-30a6-4494-8391-c939c6673545-0
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:46.616
So if it doesn't then it returns these
errors and it also then cheques if that

281c2c61-30a6-4494-8391-c939c6673545-1
00:29:46.616 --> 00:29:50.800
ARN is already registered, right.

b6274752-134f-4e59-80d6-c54392d06e79-0
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.920
So by looking at the external identity
table.

b7172f65-b8cd-45d3-bb6e-dcf0e3de1023-0
00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.840
So if it if it's already registered then
it returns this error.

1dd6adfb-5863-4b02-8e51-e791ab7595c0-0
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.393
So all the cheques passes,
then it returns the impacted individuals

1dd6adfb-5863-4b02-8e51-e791ab7595c0-1
00:30:05.393 --> 00:30:07.240
contacts back to B to C.

ca1cf928-d2d5-492a-b84c-30777cafce74-0
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.440
So then B to C can proceed.

48636d4c-e12c-45a0-a24d-22638d87c362-0
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.080
OK.

86aee184-caac-446f-a89a-fdbb9c349516-0
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.480
Yep, Yeah.

77059eb3-a96f-48b5-9f05-5657ce628471-0
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.920
So at the moment, I mean in Devon,
we don't have any ARNS.

1a630da1-3a59-4438-af7f-e01c2661165e-0
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:30.143
So if we need to set that up,
you had issues and so right,

1a630da1-3a59-4438-af7f-e01c2661165e-1
00:30:30.143 --> 00:30:40.020
we're still waiting for it,
but I've deployed it before,

1a630da1-3a59-4438-af7f-e01c2661165e-2
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.140
so let's continue.

1cb8cf35-a24a-44d4-ac2f-deb8340467bf-0
00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:58.560
So going back to the B to C,
so now we got partitioned policies, right?

09e19273-fda2-4f5b-ba79-5416c753a42d-0
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.960
So we need to now be able to configure
dev.

d604f381-603f-4221-977a-36fbf5664d4b-0
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:13.840
So dev was so dev dev is referring to
these sort of like root policies, right?

f0eb5751-fc1d-45be-9429-408bad0a08be-0
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:19.840
But even dev now should be looking at the
dev policies, not this fruit policies.

62763e24-e490-4c1e-974b-fa50055ff66d-0
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.520
We should be we we can later on clean up
and delete this.

d59e285b-6fdf-4826-8b2e-5be6ace95cd3-0
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.600
But instead of using dev should be.

33ceae8e-4067-477c-9dfc-ff21989178b0-0
00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:36.400
Instead of using this dev should be using
dev II sign up or sign in its own policy.

471ee6f1-2b92-4423-8b69-89e62480a009-0
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.080
So if you go to.

66809ccf-e2ec-4f48-8516-065138fa51af-0
00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:04.720
Go to the power pages and let's change
the dev to use the dev policies.

12adaabb-64dc-4340-b6ec-7adc53ce5ba8-0
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:25.450
Now security sign in providers B to C We
already have B to C configured.

7587a9f6-fd30-4dba-869e-a835f5cfabbb-0
00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.090
Yeah.

d8f8efbb-51b4-4e16-94d8-0f83c0df7b08-0
00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:31.250
Why is it this?

dbf6d9e8-9c10-4349-8368-92aa2c88479e-0
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.930
This thing is so buggy.

a64a0b58-658f-42c4-a37e-abef432f618c-0
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:43.320
This test still test have B to C
configured.

0530593c-b62f-4624-ad91-90ff4710ca5d-0
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:49.120
But why is it,
I don't know F-01 what happened with test?

128d846f-ed9a-44ba-80fb-17cc62e83ad5-0
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.680
You mean see it has B to C configured,
right?

c27b9ba2-d1b2-4db9-8fc4-5cbbf0d07335-0
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.172
But yeah,
when you go to that user interface,

c27b9ba2-d1b2-4db9-8fc4-5cbbf0d07335-1
00:32:56.172 --> 00:32:57.960
it says that it's not configured.

27f92807-23a1-4141-809e-69bb36dc4b22-0
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.333
He was trying to configure it again,
but let's see whether dev does the same

27f92807-23a1-4141-809e-69bb36dc4b22-1
00:33:05.333 --> 00:33:05.600
thing.

01fc4065-8bc3-42cf-9054-896aa8c85087-0
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:17.800
Yeah, no, I think dev is fine.

35594b29-9cc6-4de5-a1ef-2893b611ad4d-0
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.800
So dev has things populated.

3c37bfc9-564e-4858-927b-646af7ca7c3b-0
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:28.752
So what we're going to do is we're going
to change the dev to use the dev policies,

3c37bfc9-564e-4858-927b-646af7ca7c3b-1
00:33:28.752 --> 00:33:29.320
right?

a538e3e5-9c40-48bc-a1df-80504d0d799d-0
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:35.560
So their policies is dev.

a6dc72f9-327f-4c81-b405-08e7b185866d-0
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.840
So instead of so we're gonna use dev.

01436c11-8fa8-49ca-baba-187163c42b13-0
00:33:42.760 --> 00:34:19.210
Yeah, dev saved, I believe.

edfbf25c-f285-4f87-93f9-a547ea81ff03-0
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:24.930
So do I need to probably need to do a
sync, right?

535d5bf9-db28-4c56-9001-35919a9283ec-0
00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:27.570
Yeah, just right.

d9493f4d-50cf-4351-879f-faf3b6b3d2b3-0
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.730
So this redirect URA will be the same for
dev and dev.

bb94f3ce-329e-4544-9591-ebe4d6eee617-0
00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:33.290
And is it?

f5c7b8a5-8193-49d5-93fe-66a9f26f4011-0
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.520
No, it's gonna be different.

acb79667-fe9e-43e3-9345-2d4edaf3d970-0
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.800
I'll show it because now it's prefix,
right?

b0772d1b-f80b-43e4-91d9-488a510f315b-0
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.280
So dev policy will be dev prefix.

8dd2454c-878d-4577-90b4-efeaf3707269-0
00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.520
Yeah, dev in policy is dev in prefixed.

1835638b-a1e9-47cd-909a-740371c4be33-0
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:45.840
Yeah.

1e3bc2b9-1ca0-4f9e-8f86-6da269e6d3d6-0
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.360
So the URL policy URLs are prefixed by
the name.

8f42474e-577f-467e-9f94-9b296f773697-0
00:34:53.600 --> 00:35:13.151
So it is sync if I go to the dev portal
now and if I run the dev tools sign in,

8f42474e-577f-467e-9f94-9b296f773697-1
00:35:13.151 --> 00:35:27.814
it's still cached,
still using the it's doesn't reflect the

8f42474e-577f-467e-9f94-9b296f773697-2
00:35:27.814 --> 00:35:29.770
changes.

7cf91c54-94bf-4dae-91c2-c9f60cc82ee0-0
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.770
How are you seeing OK the viewer looking?

2ecb07f7-46ef-4ffa-91e6-fe4ab4f223f6-0
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.170
Do we need to do a restart or something?

35eee8cc-676d-466b-a34a-389039b01438-0
00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.610
Still not showing this these changes.

fdea4fb4-a23c-4bc9-a0ca-acd823f6b27c-0
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.160
Is it OK if I restart dev 01?

5e2c7ea5-e07e-4b39-9ae9-a6f5dde3e19c-0
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.320
I think it's one second Anuka.

aec54dcf-8d40-4e6b-bae3-69cb8e7a53c2-0
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.640
So I'm yeah, I'm in dev 011 second.

1398ae2d-829a-4999-ac24-ba9345fddac9-0
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.440
I'll let me close my screens.

0a2e440e-85d1-480d-8dce-a8fa3fea17fb-0
00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:17.520
Yeah, still not reflecting policy.

a5d144e7-cf5d-4b4c-8cc2-44ce7c16a2ce-0
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.160
Change to go into the.

73449e8e-debe-4e78-ab3f-97cfa5c22121-0
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:27.555
Yeah, you can restart it,
Close my screens,

73449e8e-debe-4e78-ab3f-97cfa5c22121-1
00:36:27.555 --> 00:36:33.280
go to to restart admin centre.

067383a1-0db3-440a-8b43-7bcd07efce43-0
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:50.340
Yeah, right.

7ded05cc-c79d-4881-9d1b-8f20e4339dff-0
00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.940
Actions restarts, right?

cdb579ea-6c1d-4044-9d90-1f9544fba15f-0
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.720
What's the dev int?

a7b23e8b-6024-410c-8e08-f22917b361aa-0
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.280
Let's change the dev int as well.

dd6b778d-8776-4275-b600-dcf535a68232-0
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.800
Make all pages.

e69f25d6-185f-480e-8416-69815f512299-0
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.510
Actually,
let's have a look at site settings.

028e394e-7672-4ba6-86e0-f492cc1f6a02-0
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:23.520
Side settings so it has PDC configured.

9da9ed27-b0fc-49e3-b5f4-56a66d5e3805-0
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:32.080
Hang on and that this is so did we change
the wrong settings?

491f5e1e-f8ca-4104-91bd-c1e46d0c8f59-0
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.080
So it went and changed to they went.

efa2a656-1738-4ca5-ae30-4aa40baf8b94-0
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:42.030
Can you go back and see if it is devent
that one the window that you have,

efa2a656-1738-4ca5-ae30-4aa40baf8b94-1
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.640
but we definitely change for dev right
here.

8a8b7133-b340-4f0a-a7fd-bae7037b3553-0
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.240
Yeah,
I thought so it was saved to dev end.

fe050237-f9e2-4c25-8f30-7d63199f6aac-0
00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:10.760
Let's go back again to dev that's dev
identified as yeah.

b0362e9b-34dd-4a79-b198-ae04bc1a0138-0
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.240
So it's dev is showing these.

1874ab30-e364-42b8-8269-2e5c862cd74f-0
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:21.972
But if I go to side settings,
the dev that's Dev 01,

1874ab30-e364-42b8-8269-2e5c862cd74f-1
00:39:21.972 --> 00:39:25.280
what you've opened hang on.

a8024c7a-1dbc-4e3a-87b9-def032b5d0a4-0
00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.520
But but the site is DEVINT, right?

b3b592a1-a5c3-4539-9f57-39b4a1cefd29-0
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.760
No, no, we didn't.

b383bc0c-c92b-4aad-8b7e-46565a1967d3-0
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.760
This DEVINT it's common for all the
environment.

0f06d24d-6f5e-44dc-ab7f-a80dd568e22a-0
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:38.600
The actual site name is DEVINT in all the
environment.

6f7d70f0-1470-450d-ab00-a703358a3789-0
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.906
Yeah, because we,
we built this site initially in DEVINT

6f7d70f0-1470-450d-ab00-a703358a3789-1
00:39:42.906 --> 00:39:43.720
environment.

31ad0129-b0a8-4dec-bffd-bb57251c535c-0
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.346
That's why the URL,
the website name is DEVINT all the

31ad0129-b0a8-4dec-bffd-bb57251c535c-1
00:39:46.346 --> 00:39:46.920
environment.

cb7c7142-a10b-4612-b7b3-7d2130789aa8-0
00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.440
So do not confuse with that you are in
Dev 01 actually.

26c1a4c9-b47f-4934-9957-2f5c46894544-0
00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.080
So this is dev 01.

e72e52cc-25ea-407a-a34b-b3241de165f4-0
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.600
Yeah, in the URL you can see 01 dev 01.

687d92cf-8314-481f-97c6-76fceda4ce44-0
00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.440
So you are in dev 01 power pages settings.

79d658c2-0c99-42a1-a57b-202859f1f469-0
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.915
OK,
let's create the dev 01 working out and

79d658c2-0c99-42a1-a57b-202859f1f469-1
00:40:03.915 --> 00:40:05.800
then we shouldn't get confused.

7771aeb9-5aaa-4c04-b86a-4f95be1606c4-0
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.600
Let's, let's see.

616d38f5-d171-4ff8-ad17-eec944715bab-0
00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:13.840
Let's see whether this can go to We see
those changes reflected.

70f92490-7621-460f-83a9-21b087e2f450-0
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.240
It's still.

2cc14ffe-2217-49fc-960b-3b2e41b614da-0
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.480
Still not using dev.

7ef65af6-6f11-495f-812a-0dca93fc7f47-0
00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.040
Why is it?

142f04e1-fbb1-4836-b98a-2eafa8ed1898-0
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.960
Do you need to change the redirect Uri?

87712163-fc99-4c25-9d8e-2b9d127c133f-0
00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:50.293
You know call like which redirect Uri
that one the redirect that is common

87712163-fc99-4c25-9d8e-2b9d127c133f-1
00:40:50.293 --> 00:40:50.960
right?

1e7bbf3a-09cf-4e37-821b-e0deb44a5ba2-0
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.800
So these are common right?

cb7d4cfb-3f5f-49d8-9cca-095d8cec8091-0
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.040
So this is generic dev BTC URL.

a3e4f23e-d440-426c-bc19-1d02d6e86656-0
00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:03.226
But what you see the valid issuers, right,
It will replace that with the default

a3e4f23e-d440-426c-bc19-1d02d6e86656-1
00:41:03.226 --> 00:41:04.320
policy ID, Yes.

f359e57c-0a40-44ac-b47f-624c7445459d-0
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.760
So no, no, no, not replace.

0842069a-708d-4441-b274-818064812690-0
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.080
It's append, OK.

353a1496-e21b-49c4-aca4-bf575cdb3547-0
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:21.008
So what I expect it to be like this so
that, so if you look at this value here,

353a1496-e21b-49c4-aca4-bf575cdb3547-1
00:41:21.008 --> 00:41:26.210
OK, So yeah, it's coming like that.

a4db277b-2340-4ad4-8bca-8e4089c3b997-0
00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:27.170
There's this one here.

0eabd459-1a1c-43c1-b808-0a79de9b8ce3-0
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.010
Yeah, this one here need to change.

6912129f-3931-4b2e-a95f-760ebfa297de-0
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:37.320
OK, Yeah, I think need to be changed.

dc1ecdb4-7dd7-41ef-b07d-1586407eb20b-0
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.080
Yeah.

356c4e18-f868-419b-8526-7d03222e9afd-0
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:50.380
So Yep.

5f14224b-b5eb-4ebd-b60e-5667a1d6e9ed-0
00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.180
OK, let's try now.

45f7bd71-1b2b-414f-a876-e91d93975b98-0
00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.980
Think it's saved?

4da89eba-daf1-4737-a881-335c3a9e7e71-0
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:10.230
Lost it?

a4079e6d-739b-4937-9c71-61b2565c6e29-0
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.720
Why is it showing configure wait to see
again?

02187825-6b40-439f-904a-b46082e49d1b-0
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.240
It's, it's a bug, right?

7069639a-1ffc-4fe9-95ed-59e0dc7141fa-0
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.960
It, it's a bug in portal.

88fd3814-d55f-4122-9b4c-d63f2e78a75f-0
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:39.186
It can't,
it sometimes loses and it does weird,

88fd3814-d55f-4122-9b4c-d63f2e78a75f-1
00:42:39.186 --> 00:42:40.840
weird things.

24080258-5c09-42db-90d6-b2fbeb1f8653-0
00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:51.650
So is it saved?

cb48c9c8-8a56-4b1a-8356-54e7b7cbabf2-0
00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:53.130
It's saved.

0bc84b9c-995d-4627-8652-fa55f143f75a-0
00:42:53.130 --> 00:43:02.920
Yeah, yeah,
this is saved and that's retrieved URL.

dfd3b2c7-05c8-4d7b-886d-8d70de394051-0
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:03.880
There was.

264fd1d5-66a5-461a-b963-078cfb8cfbe6-0
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.880
Yeah, valid issues.

cb94dae0-907a-4da9-a429-4ae732599ff0-0
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.400
Yeah, it's all saved.

63f445e9-47f8-43df-b613-2e7d77ee560f-0
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.200
OK what happens now?

ec3064ea-28d6-4559-813e-63146fb0a9eb-0
00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.300
Try to sync and then maybe sync again.

64cc0432-71d8-4b65-a0d2-d89554ce2edb-0
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.100
Yeah, yeah.

580e1a64-fc79-45a8-993e-f2130e44c6f0-0
00:43:44.960 --> 00:44:10.240
Think right,
is it not connecting to the policy?

2c7b1fd4-9f62-417e-82ad-eb4a4895a3fd-0
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:22.300
I think I'm,
I think what's happening here is so the B

2c7b1fd4-9f62-417e-82ad-eb4a4895a3fd-1
00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:31.080
to C has a client application
representing the portal.

54f53fcc-8bfd-43d3-a621-39dbd68231a9-0
00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:43.400
So that client application is so client
application.

ec0f71f3-33f0-48d0-a979-61e6b427a297-0
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.360
Is this OK?

ed4444c0-3b4c-4676-9c66-e1bcfe944398-0
00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.720
I think the redirect URL doesn't match
redirect URL.

d1cc63cb-3cf1-4d69-b025-71e0edbe1c2a-0
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.880
No, that should be fine.

3d63ddf5-d9da-49bb-95d4-6fdb0c80f459-0
00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:12.600
That should let's check so this is the
yesterday test application.

fa76daa0-283c-4f32-a3a8-9e388ddfd652-0
00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.520
So this is the redirect URL accepted.

64f9c4dd-2d69-48a0-9e40-dc7d7fb22ad5-0
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.770
So redirect,
I don't think the redirect URL has

64f9c4dd-2d69-48a0-9e40-dc7d7fb22ad5-1
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:41.160
changed because we haven't changed the
redirect URL, Yeah.

1e2f92be-24c1-44f9-b781-616c328bf0af-0
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:56.720
So what is it that's clear this portal?

2a91b30d-3f07-4dad-9474-a059c503a409-0
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.800
Clear it again.

39df0041-c3f3-4864-bb0b-3448ea6dbbb1-0
00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.420
See, for some reason,
maybe it needs another restart.

5c168a5a-36ae-44eb-a5f7-a911b8ee0d40-0
00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.580
See, this doesn't have the.

db15b5e2-2004-4cb5-a0c0-3e78d2ba8a65-0
00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.540
It's still the sort of cache.

f2c52afa-449e-4db4-98fa-efda06bd874b-0
00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.580
This doesn't have the dev in it.

bbb1b256-64a8-46f0-a56e-b827387eb776-0
00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:29.340
Yeah.

774ed3a7-24f0-46e3-bae8-5a7e6efd9a86-0
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.780
Can I give it another restart?

3a88bef4-dd53-41da-811a-6ea2244789ff-0
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.140
Yep, I think OK.

107f1b69-6b01-4a1e-aa30-d8a1ddf8140d-0
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.880
So side settings were definitely updated.

c0a4dd99-3ca0-45dd-93b5-36cb35ca2f7b-0
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:06.479
Everything have dev has dev says dev
redirect URL doesn't need,

c0a4dd99-3ca0-45dd-93b5-36cb35ca2f7b-1
00:47:06.479 --> 00:47:08.920
it's just generic.

7c515045-88cc-4e2a-99df-ccab874a30fb-0
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.840
This is yeah.

792fa551-6646-4c62-b71e-5cc2df1de825-0
00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.080
And then that's it.

ed910103-804b-472d-86b2-996c44e1889f-0
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.960
What about the login button type?

fb69d501-2e44-4740-ace9-075c6f8f171b-0
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.320
What's this?

c429c2a9-0b93-47bb-9488-6f10cdf364d8-0
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.920
I have no idea what that is.

81668d95-64a2-4571-a2b5-d05e3f23fa57-0
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.581
Do you have the list of settings that you
modify when you change anything from B to

81668d95-64a2-4571-a2b5-d05e3f23fa57-1
00:47:32.581 --> 00:47:32.880
C side?

166300f9-9256-4730-aa78-6aaa4a75fdd5-0
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.720
No, it's it's just OK,
we just portal should just do it, right?

6c4fa75f-b434-4b4e-b710-f0d1fb8177c5-0
00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.360
So we should not we should not need to
come and check the settings here.

56c3b068-e8b2-4709-9cf6-27cbae1305d6-0
00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:49.943
It should be done from the UI,
but that UI is so buggy,

56c3b068-e8b2-4709-9cf6-27cbae1305d6-1
00:47:49.943 --> 00:47:52.720
so it does some random things.

011c05f0-115a-4f0e-8fdb-f57a37183834-0
00:47:53.280 --> 00:48:14.970
So now if you go to the with the security
and it just Oh no, it still has it.

0a275bfe-b050-46ec-877c-9e8167d7d626-0
00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:16.450
No, it's still enabled.

3080c0bd-d9dc-4c55-8a39-5fb1e63e90de-0
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.880
OK, so it's back.

373d5b0a-1634-4171-b447-e0f2757fd547-0
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:26.990
Let's see.

b3d14acb-4679-4542-8616-94f78940c25a-0
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:28.430
It's restarted.

fb57fe0f-6c35-42eb-8e6c-fb872fc969e0-0
00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:32.350
Yeah, the portal is back.

59f8311f-caa3-4aa6-82f8-02fc2dbe08c6-0
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.990
Portal is back.

09a3b491-f640-4a1c-b4b7-8bb68f3865cd-0
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:37.110
Let's Yep, try again.

00aea5d8-7c6c-496e-bf4e-06f426a7d625-0
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:43.070
Trying to say again no.

a95fd258-780c-4fc9-b2c5-e78000da92bc-0
00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.240
So you saw something, right, Dhanuka?

5cfcdf72-d159-40d4-8b93-2d1052ea2ba3-0
00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:54.360
There was another one setting which was
showing up right where it didn't reflect.

83541f4c-f9c4-4571-8264-863fc80cd6b5-0
00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.920
So I think that's the URL that is showing
here.

fe02fd08-0ab8-42b9-b36e-5024f87edd4b-0
00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:57.640
V2.

22ba0d4d-0365-4aa0-a22b-06a861596f47-0
00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.440
It's a registration button.

3b628e4a-df85-4cb7-b1cf-c92c937227d4-0
00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.480
I think that's not part of the settings.

cdc310a8-37da-42d8-8ae2-16aaed4eecb7-0
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.800
So these were the settings that is coming
from that.

f3df6ac2-94f0-46bb-a3e3-58c70d00a414-0
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:12.080
But we can change it definitely because
yeah, that URL had AV 2 on it.

ca8cc493-60e1-4b15-b9ad-07fa4b6ec2bf-0
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:19.297
I'm not sure if it is related, but yeah,
I'm able to sign in inside using B to C

ca8cc493-60e1-4b15-b9ad-07fa4b6ec2bf-1
00:49:19.297 --> 00:49:21.080
You can, yeah, yeah.

7a47a4a6-6748-477c-b6bf-b5a091730a2a-0
00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:27.526
But using that custom button, I tried,
I didn't try from the URL the navigation

7a47a4a6-6748-477c-b6bf-b5a091730a2a-1
00:49:27.526 --> 00:49:28.480
sign in button.

501c3e6d-9a50-407d-9277-cbc5617ba2b2-0
00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.440
So it's interesting.

24f81e11-74da-45c9-a511-3e83c1a9b084-0
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.160
What is the custom button redirect to?

6684c176-9e46-4211-8195-b4a809124b8d-0
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.680
Need to check it out one second.

2ef50fee-4ddd-41f6-b662-f02dd51c47b5-0
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.190
Yeah, that is taking dev.

26bdd21d-77b5-4362-86c3-2d637950ae80-0
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:48.720
It is taking dev, but yeah,
that is that is the code behind, right?

499d4012-2d98-4607-9f46-a3f9c332753f-0
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.720
So we yeah, modified the URL in the core.

c682cdaf-d046-4d71-bdce-5b46d5310d72-0
00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:51.960
Yeah.

e567376f-e2d3-459d-aca9-9361108a4a5b-0
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.800
So some URL.

7c2e31d3-b0fc-46ea-a7b6-02c9ba7961b4-0
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.520
No, no, that's fine.

09344c25-478a-4698-940c-b68fc5e85f8c-0
00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:00.541
But yeah,
for some reason these settings are not

09344c25-478a-4698-940c-b68fc5e85f8c-1
00:50:00.541 --> 00:50:01.280
actually.

2a6c0904-a198-4d12-a857-73f64ff8c123-0
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:06.600
So this is not set as default,
set as default.

94bc66ed-152c-4190-8e0e-c9faa779c1da-0
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.400
Let me set this as default.

56425dd5-a211-4139-8469-080919026c19-0
00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.040
It came out of default.

291721ff-59a9-4fb9-b104-4cf12d6b0711-0
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.760
Sync it.

6788d9a3-ed14-483a-baf3-309774431ced-0
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.320
I think now it is working.

d45900f5-098a-4442-a6a2-7668eb4a742a-0
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.440
Renuka, it's now working, yeah.

ae304763-986a-4758-9b0e-76230598c8a9-0
00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.240
Yeah, sign in is working.

bbf56e4c-a2c4-4044-9280-24b53e6e6a7f-0
00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.560
It is redirecting to that, Yeah.

f9839aa6-a8d7-4d72-98d5-6f52e54faaca-0
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:37.520
So could you guys try signing in today?

28e45df3-a55f-4fcf-8e04-0f98ae115e3d-0
00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:42.840
Yep, it should work.

2d79d1a7-4458-44ab-a056-cfbb2067a60d-0
00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.160
So now if so, let's go to dev int now.

8730cb6d-cfd8-44ae-bc83-ff213ce864f3-0
00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.840
So if I configured there one is working,
I will log in inside.

18162904-8672-48b8-a282-91208911b91d-0
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.040
Yeah, yeah, nice, cool.

19433569-3d10-48e7-b4c5-482d0dc8c6c9-0
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:21.000
All good.

5d40e73e-cc59-46b8-bbc4-65dc4f8e8b53-0
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.280
So now I'm in dev int, right?

8a928426-48ce-44f6-8d30-1673857c1280-0
00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.040
So there's no B2C configured here, right?

df68ad0b-3ed0-43bf-a2c5-fe0a2b40c2cc-0
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.114
Yeah,
we didn't configure before then when's

df68ad0b-3ed0-43bf-a2c5-fe0a2b40c2cc-1
00:51:38.114 --> 00:51:39.080
this first time?

be1f130a-7a5b-4d90-b854-62c823f57439-0
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:51.679
OK, So if I just copy the stuff from here,
it's not going to override the dev

be1f130a-7a5b-4d90-b854-62c823f57439-1
00:51:51.679 --> 00:51:53.960
settings, right?

9aa6cb15-dc71-46c7-99c3-9b40d1fe1cd9-0
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:54.360
It should.

d88b3b56-bb78-421d-b94e-6f027a3620de-0
00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.570
No, no,
that is different website then it won't,

d88b3b56-bb78-421d-b94e-6f027a3620de-1
00:51:57.570 --> 00:51:58.160
it won't.

4dbc1bc9-6651-4244-afe8-0bbf83f6a879-0
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:05.160
OK, let's yeah copy this next.

e920677d-ef6f-4d75-8b71-59bd7dc1bfbf-0
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:19.040
Replace this to dev int, client ID,
client ID.

ef98d0a5-3886-4c74-bed2-135a538eac36-0
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:26.120
Can we use the same client dev int here?

3102e19f-e13d-4fb8-8dbe-ce8bbd020881-0
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:36.228
OK,
maybe we'll do the dev int another time

3102e19f-e13d-4fb8-8dbe-ce8bbd020881-1
00:52:36.228 --> 00:52:44.147
because I think if Pradeep is not here,
Pradeep need to add dev went to this list

3102e19f-e13d-4fb8-8dbe-ce8bbd020881-2
00:52:44.147 --> 00:52:44.920
of URLs.

72893300-03a4-45bf-bf0a-fe074cebc7a5-0
00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.680
OK, or we create or create a new separate.

dd68f11e-d323-48a2-ab7e-f4dbf73f35bf-0
00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.525
I think we'll instead of creating a
separate temporary session,

dd68f11e-d323-48a2-ab7e-f4dbf73f35bf-1
00:52:54.525 --> 00:52:57.240
we'll just use the same thing,
but we need to add.

145705c1-a6b0-4946-b5ef-d1579a0d3226-0
00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.520
So I think one of the things you guys
need.

e163a9ad-7237-4a2f-87c6-28641f43be6b-0
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.040
I'm here.

ee85e604-9b96-499b-b7b9-9c2efd852be4-0
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.280
Denuka, I'm not sure if you can hear me.

a2e06473-ec1e-4375-98e6-860b0a2a9824-0
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:03.840
I can hear now.

1739b1d0-237f-45bb-9f3d-380a07fb0c49-0
00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.520
I mean, I mean all the time here,
but I think you guys sorry.

44008ea6-13d0-4c10-ba87-0f05169c7f65-0
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.000
I I have one screen.

0cb810c7-0bd5-4aca-8118-d21bc498dcdb-0
00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.240
I Oh, I see.

2afde839-be17-488f-8910-c40bc99b435a-0
00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.120
Yeah, I see.

76e23edf-75fa-4bfb-ba55-90b94b5b859b-0
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.400
OK, so could could we add?

c4122e8d-7187-4486-a9eb-5f162aff0ef4-0
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:19.320
No way could we add the dev int URL here.

283e4327-5456-48b7-916f-3609108805df-0
00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.560
I don't think I have permissions.

42f6af6f-dcaa-421f-ab48-2b3f0fb2ba77-0
00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:34.240
I think you probably are owner or yeah,
you are owner.

94721c6d-9dfe-4c44-b3b2-5132a0373a05-0
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:43.087
I I can configure this, but yeah,
let's do it the next time because next

94721c6d-9dfe-4c44-b3b2-5132a0373a05-1
00:53:43.087 --> 00:53:47.195
time I have only 5 minutes left and yeah,
Yeah,

94721c6d-9dfe-4c44-b3b2-5132a0373a05-2
00:53:47.195 --> 00:53:52.159
by the time I'm login and everything,
it will be be over.

79626086-4943-461b-a59c-ec4261014074-0
00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.960
All right,
Let's configure the dev int next Monday.

5e99d5f0-f670-4722-a351-1e54aeeb93e7-0
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:56.880
Yeah, We can do on Monday.

caeeb61b-8ae9-4318-8874-280a4c5e1b6c-0
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.800
Yeah, yeah, Monday.

58272f58-4852-438a-8017-6925c0a2eaf1-0
00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.320
So I'll have it ready.

d293e4bf-15d7-4310-b177-9859bc7b1391-0
00:53:59.520 --> 00:53:59.880
OK.

ce4c2986-1b9a-4ea2-abf7-370c72e5768c-0
00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.520
Yeah, I'll have it ready.

4026a6af-b925-4f1b-af02-de6d51bc661f-0
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:02.240
Yeah.

3ae6872d-1427-4fdd-b48e-041a142e9db2-0
00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.480
And we can just.

f86449a0-f99f-4346-9054-1c3e6d7eabd0-0
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.920
Yeah, take it from there.

a922abbe-f3c9-4dd2-8e95-deac3c3038ab-0
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:14.600
If you can share the URL with me,
redial to all, I'll use the same.

b6cc7007-8120-423d-a6b8-b977d5feef95-0
00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:14.920
OK.

fc5ec6f5-5598-4fc0-acab-97e4eff379de-0
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:15.800
Yep, it's the same.

9adabf83-8987-43cb-bc73-35b64f5d858a-0
00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.600

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:19.880

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:25.720
OK.

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:31.160
For the, you want to do 1 and 2 both,
not just one, just one for now.

4fff5efd-542a-464f-a068-c20923bb7cdf-0

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:39.003
OK, maybe maybe while you add it,
just add 2 as well,

0d746342-a140-4219-8c54-512533da9492-1
00:54:39.003 --> 00:54:43.080

in there.
