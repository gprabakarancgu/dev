5a52929a-8a85-4fa8-ba4f-1c351cfd5d9f-0
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.760
Yep.

86b9df35-34e8-4a10-89ee-50644d923e43-0
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.640
All right.

7d98ca73-09f2-4d2f-a86b-70c7ecfb5695-0
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.637
So today what we are planning to do was
come configure the event for B to C,

7d98ca73-09f2-4d2f-a86b-70c7ecfb5695-1
00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:15.600
right, let's do that.

f1d0e204-9d03-4b9c-a0dd-41ea6ca55927-0
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.160
Let's go to the event.

42cd200f-a2c0-4013-836a-6e2ebfb44d9d-0
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:44.940
Didn't, didn't we do that on Friday?

f38a0f07-caca-48b9-8988-5a06611c07c0-0
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.500
We've you configure the policy and so we
did that for dev, right.

82d74bc0-2f5d-4e9f-8281-d8fbe1b61833-0
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.828
So dev,
we changed from the default policy to the

82d74bc0-2f5d-4e9f-8281-d8fbe1b61833-1
00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:56.300
partition policy.

d06b6c8b-7ea0-4a69-a2e1-ba61db0e8fec-0
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.780
So now we're gonna do devent.

86ad9a41-f875-40d9-b088-5934d75be08f-0
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.500
OK, Yeah, I think we OK, let's see here.

428b4fd7-a07f-46ac-aef6-22aa44c870b8-0
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:18.900
OK, another type, I'm opening up the dev.

875dc377-2802-444f-af3e-211129eacb91-0
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:45.853
So I think the issue that there's a
couple of settings that are in the event

875dc377-2802-444f-af3e-211129eacb91-1
00:01:45.853 --> 00:02:03.740
causing problems 1 is this 1 here or
maybe delete this?

af16e06c-7b95-4b4c-bb75-a42872114a27-0
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.500
I'll delete this setting.

141593ca-e20d-43af-a7b7-cd88e8d4d011-0
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.340
So so now a search for B to C in other
settings.

8d9eb23b-b21a-428d-b34e-d009c977f0fc-0
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.000
That's only BDC setting that we've got.

03fa65b7-c5ef-4a63-95f9-b64e1f085766-0
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.400
I think this got copied from there,
so we need this setting for this to work.

86cffdc3-f5cf-4f88-82c1-ad475385a212-0
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.483
To this button to work,
we need that setting,

86cffdc3-f5cf-4f88-82c1-ad475385a212-1
00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:52.200
so that's driven from that.

ab0d957f-fdb5-41d9-ae03-a74a3119620c-0
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.480
So we'll delete for now and we'll
configure the VTC from.

07050e50-eea4-4c79-b761-cb7dfeb1af2e-0
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.160
Does it normally take this long to delete
the setting?

75824b8a-bad4-48a3-92a9-18e2b11edb46-0
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.800
Sometimes if you're using now devint it
will take time Where do you go?

cad53f4a-7f4e-4411-b4a7-2106b132ce80-0
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.650
But it's the first time then it will take
time otherwise.

70e7752d-6311-44ae-9fc7-835d139926d3-0
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.720
Oh, what can you sync it?

ecc41a34-fb89-463d-a398-5ca09e03612f-0
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.160
Because one of the site setting we
deleted now, right?

087eff8f-a536-4595-9d50-ee3812792685-0
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.000
Yeah.

0e0af33f-db0e-47ff-a838-56c6cc7ef182-0
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.880
Can you sync?

1005f3e0-c1f7-4c46-8c42-ab9b6947a007-0
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.800
Oh, we are not able to sync it.

689425a1-5cf1-4b2d-9286-4d6ea26fd526-0
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.720
Let me try from my end.

c2782f1f-f7f6-45cd-8257-df99e06da969-0
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.980
On the site can you guys see it?

d78c4c6e-6cd3-4617-bf1c-f0d3d6317e13-0
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:55.120

8d58c8da-0ae1-4b7f-b3a7-8cbbcd303f7a-0
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.800
Yes, Tanuka,
I am here and give me a second.

9011d1ef-08e3-4d4f-8b0e-ab5d21819651-0
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.240
You know what's happening here?

1eedb2e4-3c9b-43ce-ae6e-c90e2ad19311-0
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.280
I just deleted the setting,
but seems like this code deleted.

2ae9423d-6d3c-433a-a1ea-f619116c5ffb-0
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.880
The website has been changed.

af949040-8cbb-4633-8243-aa220d824736-0
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.960
Code deleted.

d0579a6c-d21b-4c0e-9734-6b49277b6f69-0
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.120
This is escort.

f5a22036-6814-4585-abd6-5771467f6fb9-0
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.040
And what setting did you delete?

62fa3d64-9473-4566-8257-cc54926f3f8c-0
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.360
Sorry.

e2f2fcd6-ba3e-4205-8e84-ec99c2384742-0
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The we had a custom setting called
authentication something.

e2a3e0ba-85d0-41ac-9254-b92b5227a6b6-0
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.480
Yeah.

bcb6bcc5-9dbe-434b-b56e-7e5855b1222f-0
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.000
Authenticate.

213a5729-5e12-4d87-8266-ef6a71c5dad4-0
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.520
Need to see authentication something.

641c5e21-c1f5-4877-aab0-9c7d6e004b04-0
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.280
Yeah.

49cf442b-58b0-4315-bf7b-646b2b416aa5-0
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.160
OK, who is who is this tab setting?

581c9a79-b0f9-4dfa-b957-ce83475b2077-0
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.480
Just just one setting you deleted?

8d944519-7a67-4115-9f96-7783ea6e2e94-0
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.680
Yeah, one setting, Yeah.

2ecb9978-e4de-48df-8d78-9264bfee5c55-0
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.120
Let me have a look.

ec364229-e468-44b5-8dad-b5271a3ac152-0
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.529
So we could restart the site and see if
after Pradeep investigating it,

ec364229-e468-44b5-8dad-b5271a3ac152-1
00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:00.590
you want me to restart or you guys

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.720
Yeah, probably.

984f54cb-6a94-4ec6-800b-d794b417f573-0
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.000
We can restart and see whether it's
fixing.

96da47fc-fcef-43a9-a8d9-5332708c9152-0
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.840
Yeah, because I won't be.

69ecdf8a-31f6-46f7-b5a0-98cce34208ea-0
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.960
I won't be able to see anything.

41798c27-b7bd-4d3e-89c0-ac71713475bc-0
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.200
OK.

c73349ed-95e8-44b8-a176-9a429a3a4d32-0
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.680
Anyway, you did restart first.

ce7965a3-bd8f-47ed-afb9-75a1d4da3f51-0
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.000
Yeah, I think that that site disappeared.

33812f9d-d629-4d76-9d15-3907d5e0bef6-0
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:16.960
Yeah.

cc7a8af3-79fe-4a33-9837-71f42f44c833-0
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.680
The site itself, it's not there.

b4533873-0b44-4314-bd40-f6990bc954a9-0
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.400
Even active site, inactive site,
it's not there.

1cdeed82-0f35-4bba-893d-a867863c9772-0
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.720
I don't know.

336e4249-d553-49bf-8148-9e98550a01c5-0
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.880
It just disappeared.

87d5be85-bd2a-4ead-98f9-6c3c75842416-0
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.880
You deleted the site, Dinuka.

a69dd97c-eff6-44e7-894c-a26f875ec6c6-0
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.200
I'm I'm scared to touch these settings.

cb9fb374-f80b-41fa-966f-e39892d14190-0
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.280
Is it's OK?

e00a5ac3-2e26-40ea-9770-090243be3af9-0
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.640
They can restore it if it is.

a1afb958-d12a-425f-ac73-2e32baedcc9f-0
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.769
There's no button to restart any No,
the site action Yeah, yeah,

a1afb958-d12a-425f-ac73-2e32baedcc9f-1
00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:50.080
restart the site.

41a2bcc9-9ca7-427d-9ed3-146aa0837e6d-0
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.684
If it doesn't work,
then we can get 30 minutes before and we

41a2bcc9-9ca7-427d-9ed3-146aa0837e6d-1
00:07:59.684 --> 00:08:01.560
can restore it that package.

59eef7e5-0006-4deb-bb97-3806ee762b2a-0
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.120
But was it working before?

eace53fc-c1dd-4972-8154-0cc853c9e07b-0
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.160
Yeah, always working.

260c16b6-4787-4981-8952-5eae04fce2b8-0
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:31.730
OK,
how do we know where the stream started?

d99264ed-817d-4848-a68e-8d994fbc91f1-0
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.850
Yes, go to the admin centre itself.

182468ef-9a97-427a-95ba-91d7441554e1-0
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.410
I can open from there.

e577904e-e7c1-48c6-9ac1-d30801549048-0
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.730

centre.

But I think the site is gone.

65d7aa3b-0d22-4090-9635-e26c43cea28f-0
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.040
OK, So we can restore it then,
right Pradeep?

8e46492e-c45b-450b-879a-9d2522d6044b-0
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.880

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.080
Table maintenance, I think 3 dots.

b4f0d0dc-ecd0-4303-b40d-ed575188f391-0
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.440
Can you click the three dots?

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.720
Let me let me restore.

bf674503-17d8-4950-bab6-98279d04acdc-0
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.120
Oh, OK.

Yeah.

aa4baa7e-03d8-40d8-8095-2315e994d037-0
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.360
That's not you know, Yeah.

bf29fa42-49e4-427b-9009-c0bedd39675d-0
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.360

next week.

6f1d0bc6-a23c-457f-8952-13a4ed7c0540-0
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.160
OK.

77f360d5-ad2f-4427-b0c1-da6ecf1229f1-0

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.120
If anything gets done under his his
account.

47e9b79a-03a9-4ba3-9d54-f6d74e49a975-0
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:46.720

I'm still here for another two weeks.

a7310e60-e6f0-485e-8734-dc15f959987b-0
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.760
Then probably in the meantime,
we can focus on something else.

a15ef9db-e19f-4793-b424-60d5b77060a1-0
00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.560
It will take time.

dd1e3e9c-5580-41b0-b574-988c920c9476-0
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.080
At least it'll take time, right?

9c64babf-bfd6-43ce-a883-59474805046a-0
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.240
Yeah.

9c7822d8-acb1-41df-8075-2ebb3208676d-0
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.680
Half, like half an hour.

65f1bc48-ded6-455b-8284-6f98408eeb97-0
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.200
Or is it taking long enough?

baf9a726-085a-42cc-9902-8277aa5beeee-0
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.280
Half an hour.

8cf9278b-5edd-4139-b573-7c4e935ec5e8-0
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.160
Minutes into 30 minutes.

3eb841ca-9865-47ce-a1f5-a7e12ccb52ed-0
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.120
Do you have to notify anyone?

f9401130-8520-46f9-8dad-387a34c0de01-0
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.600
Yeah, we can.

b2f743a0-6df1-4fab-bc3d-316d91e08e86-0
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.400
You can just put a message,
Pradeep in this group.

ab411178-fa1e-470c-9dce-322abb256c94-0
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.320
Which will.

1c79e1eb-8484-4003-b6f2-dc452617fb91-0
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.160
All right, Only this group.

8eb70564-1d3e-44a5-83b3-a8050471c575-0
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.520
No, no, no, no, no, DEVINT.

edba9725-fe9f-4478-a608-337b18518e59-0
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.600
No one is using it.

c5ab8880-e7cb-4ceb-a82e-5137da1aa903-0
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.880
No one is using DEVINT.

f516f896-e360-4d0e-92cc-0e3ef477dff7-0
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:27.710
OK,
I just want to make sure before people

f516f896-e360-4d0e-92cc-0e3ef477dff7-1
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.000
start making noise, OK?

7fe1a3e2-2655-4791-aa69-ff4d92223940-0
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.320
Devint.

5273a108-6e89-4e69-92d6-924e213254b7-0
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:42.175
All right, so while we're waiting,
so who the next thing I wanted to get you

5273a108-6e89-4e69-92d6-924e213254b7-1
00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:47.480
guys through is the the RMA sign up
implementation.

8d64bd96-9009-483d-8abf-08da3103cf07-0
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.760
So I've got some of that working.

da318285-b707-4571-a852-77c0221a509d-0
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.720
So let me share my screen back again.

af815727-1629-4b7b-bf67-8f44f42a94ec-0
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:11.160
So I have a branch called invite only in
in in code.

da6336ee-14b6-48ad-86f3-f54c3bef0159-0
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:17.840
So if you pull down that branch,
so you see all the invite only.

71e0ab5e-ba5b-48ad-9f74-55fa14d74440-0
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.000
So I'm I'm assuming that we're going to
go ahead with invite only.

4b88a68f-1ce2-4855-8fa6-b8a1dc24bdc6-0
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.520
I think we preset now that we go with
invite only.

29a3da5b-3d3c-4872-b0f4-d10a815207d2-0
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:40.735
So those changes are in the,
there's a branch called invite only

29a3da5b-3d3c-4872-b0f4-d10a815207d2-1
00:11:40.735 --> 00:11:47.440
saying invite only have the the changes.

d0a5bf88-fad3-4867-a788-396b74b1ba2e-0
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:56.120
So I've kept the impacted individual ones
as it is.

06d492e5-443b-4296-95e4-1aee9a973b63-0
00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.335
I,
I haven't touched it because I don't know

06d492e5-443b-4296-95e4-1aee9a973b63-1
00:12:00.335 --> 00:12:03.240
how we're going to roll it out.

bec0a554-c501-41d8-8e27-24dd558c3b01-0
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.440
So if you roll it out in a sort of like
incremental way,

bec0a554-c501-41d8-8e27-24dd558c3b01-1
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:17.560
we'll so we have the option of keeping
impacted individual in there.

fdff2ad3-4421-4449-9b5b-33012a152ac7-0
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:25.920
So you can see if you go to that.

1aec7b7b-a9cb-49eb-8624-b44339182b55-0
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:34.258
So if you go to B to C and if you type
dev_So these are the all the policies

1aec7b7b-a9cb-49eb-8624-b44339182b55-1
00:12:34.258 --> 00:12:36.000
that we've got now.

2299fae3-e605-4368-a672-af2072a47397-0
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:45.477
So, so impact of individual other,
the impact individual related policies,

2299fae3-e605-4368-a672-af2072a47397-1
00:12:45.477 --> 00:12:52.934
sign prefix II policies and all the
generic As for stuff in the As for

2299fae3-e605-4368-a672-af2072a47397-2
00:12:52.934 --> 00:12:53.880
policies.

106e3e6e-bab6-45c1-9605-b7b8547d2378-0
00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:00.720
And now you can see there's As for sign
in &amp; up.

19bc090d-a4eb-4921-b035-2951b5bcab08-0
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.760
So that's the invite only starting point.

65598196-6770-4ee7-9b2a-afb011820d72-0
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:14.327
And most of the logic for that invite
only is in this portal portal extension

65598196-6770-4ee7-9b2a-afb011820d72-1
00:13:14.327 --> 00:13:15.200
policy.

928bc22c-8513-46f8-bad5-d32de7c31b06-0
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.040
You can see.

d4f00f1c-4e8a-4b01-8bcd-74869e8d9c62-0
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.040
So you can run it now.

e6262f11-4437-4968-8a49-06f9f7819e9c-0
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.040
So I'm running the invite RMA 1.

17d110f5-5b7f-4b22-9c27-735e96d60a8c-0
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.856
So,
so that should have all the new styling

17d110f5-5b7f-4b22-9c27-735e96d60a8c-1
00:13:32.856 --> 00:13:33.240
in it.

d49a8751-1f13-4563-b65a-add2f1cdec50-0
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.280
Can you would you be able to expand the
window that you're showing?

21db1f27-4716-4b50-b160-9f4afc06f0d3-0
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.120
Because it is very small, actually.

4f8ae57e-d39e-4b5d-98e6-27843f4b79fc-0
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.680
OK,
maybe I'll Shim so I have the larger

4f8ae57e-d39e-4b5d-98e6-27843f4b79fc-1
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.200
screen.

82ab7fb8-5e96-469d-8840-b440d37eb834-0
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.400
I'll use my laptop.

ea05445a-7c74-4568-ba2e-7d01ec6a32ce-0
00:13:52.880 --> 00:14:00.960
OK Is it better now?

ed953d04-db10-4b37-8910-b87ebafc0293-0
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.880
Yeah, this is OK.

36402718-0fbd-461e-b43b-fb8492846c6e-0
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:05.600
Yeah.

5689939d-4b14-4bac-bdb0-e7c62d7d08ee-0
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:12.480
So sign up.

5ef48e11-d221-4a67-a051-46c03907ba19-0
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.440
So now we'll ask for ARN.

5cc4918d-21e8-4b97-8b51-b1fde5d4197b-0
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:27.840
So depending on the ARN,
it will show the relevant sign up.

20bd9474-cf1b-4ee0-8a7d-50794414c579-0
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.160
So let me go back in here.

8016b1c9-6afa-4f2b-b2b9-e8e932ccf5b6-0
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.971
So the way that would work is so as I
said,

8016b1c9-6afa-4f2b-b2b9-e8e932ccf5b6-1
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:44.960
so you can always start with the entry
point.

8f6f638e-bef0-4d62-a220-a0f5f13f5abb-0
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:53.640
So in entry point there's a base policy
and base policy has a default user

8f6f638e-bef0-4d62-a220-a0f5f13f5abb-1
00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.520
journey.

67b7396c-8e11-4604-aea1-528d35523290-0
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.080
So that that's the starting point.

52157792-c0df-4eef-8564-14f9e411b645-0
00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:03.120
So let's go to the base policy and the
user user journey.

5df14fe6-fac7-47a4-aa8d-65079c006bcd-0
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.200
Yeah, so this is the user journey.

cb50db06-a2cf-40e6-b966-873b5e3767b9-0
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:13.960
So this same very similar to the Qi
policy have explained before.

76e6bee3-0c5e-4bb9-b503-0f5b83f82077-0
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.120
So the first three steps in the user
journey are related to the blocking the

76e6bee3-0c5e-4bb9-b503-0f5b83f82077-1
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:29.360
default DNS and the next one is getting
the query string parameter sign up on

76e6bee3-0c5e-4bb9-b503-0f5b83f82077-2
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.080
this query string parameter which is we
still need for MA.

498bcedb-8ba6-4ca9-b7e2-db7a47ddee70-0
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:45.056
So I kept kept it as it is and then if
the query string parameter is sign up

498bcedb-8ba6-4ca9-b7e2-db7a47ddee70-1
00:15:45.056 --> 00:15:47.520
flow then we show.

12510378-3a22-49ce-8eef-a1f385a468dc-0
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.360
So I think this need to change a little
bit.

75f99e20-72a2-444b-bddc-c8f18ce58c6b-0
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.960
The I think I haven't that coalition
parameter flow.

3f8601af-c29f-4e2a-a9a1-ac75d9079434-0
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.960
I haven't edited.

a58853d0-a1b4-4556-b5e1-1d0d9b3d8c07-0
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.080
Let me get back to it.

c881b749-997e-4dae-8038-fcddf9a808a7-0
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:11.760
But if it is not coalition parameter flow,
the first step to show is ARM validation.

08e0349f-d248-4632-9946-16f77614e098-0
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:24.509
So once the ARN validation is successful
then the user will be redirected to the

08e0349f-d248-4632-9946-16f77614e098-1
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:27.440
relevant sign up flow.

60fad2e0-9de9-4f6f-9836-bf7035672976-0
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.920
So if you look at the ARN validation,
ARN verification.

ca62443d-8144-436c-a75d-237d2de39991-0
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.280
So what ARN verification is?

91abe206-d3d7-417f-9116-a5315d20d11d-0
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:45.360
So it's just asking for ARN and these are
coming from the API.

f99310d2-7859-4149-ba02-986e525a8065-0
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.880
So then it will call call API to verify
they are in.

6bcf95d1-94ff-4218-81c9-7d4b73617798-0
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.547
So the call API to verify will call
identity contact,

6bcf95d1-94ff-4218-81c9-7d4b73617798-1
00:16:59.547 --> 00:17:06.040
verify endpoint and passes the ARN and
the token to the API.

b3ba36a2-d74d-48d9-9f91-e4e132c8430d-0
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.592
So if you go to the API,
now API is in the source folder,

b3ba36a2-d74d-48d9-9f91-e4e132c8430d-1
00:17:13.592 --> 00:17:17.560
so it caused the contact controller.

f1fb34c0-a593-4e8b-a4e2-798a54f7f92f-0
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.240
They go to the contract controller verify
right?

d0a7de4b-0e84-4f74-bc3f-6ac15c228ebd-0
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.320
So it should be verified as the normal
thing.

b5a01e7d-9491-494c-bb0f-b9019f706456-0
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:37.991
It cheques whether the the API call B to
CS provided AARN and if there's ARN it it

b5a01e7d-9491-494c-bb0f-b9019f706456-1
00:17:37.991 --> 00:17:39.920
verifies right.

8430174f-c101-4ffc-8499-3102c08fc37f-0
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:48.520
So what it does is it gets the contact by
ARN.

04542510-1476-4652-af13-623d3096c7d9-0
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:55.973
So at the moment this is if you go and
contact by ARN,

04542510-1476-4652-af13-623d3096c7d9-1
00:17:55.973 --> 00:18:05.233
it it queries the contacts table in
database and tries to match the ARN with

04542510-1476-4652-af13-623d3096c7d9-2
00:18:05.233 --> 00:18:08.600
the contact ID field, right?

1f2435c6-a2b9-4743-a67a-8cf08f0c3b37-0
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.600
But this is not the right field.

77b8547a-c2c6-48c0-a806-8653a7b06fc5-0
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.913
So in the future you guys will implement
the proper ARN and you guys will have a

77b8547a-c2c6-48c0-a806-8653a7b06fc5-1
00:18:15.913 --> 00:18:17.280
column for ARN, right?

d978159f-31ed-4b3e-9fae-65a95c33bf02-0
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:26.121
So, so when that's ready,
this need to be changed to whatever that

d978159f-31ed-4b3e-9fae-65a95c33bf02-1
00:18:26.121 --> 00:18:30.080
column is to to match the ARN.

414105c5-89bc-4212-ac39-b2cfdd5a0c5f-0
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.160
So that's a future change when when you
guys are ready.

73dd9d6d-1c1d-4ed6-9b2e-806dfb67bf11-0
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:43.960
So once the the contact is received,
so if the if there's no contact found,

73dd9d6d-1c1d-4ed6-9b2e-806dfb67bf11-1
00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:49.560
then there will be error,
there's no matching record.

b4331cc8-65ec-44f5-83d3-b97ff81f6270-0
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:57.946
And if there is a contact then I'll check
with the the contact is already signed up

b4331cc8-65ec-44f5-83d3-b97ff81f6270-1
00:18:57.946 --> 00:19:00.880
that the RN is already signed up.

f5af12f1-f3e4-4545-94aa-7437f0a11c2e-0
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:07.283
So if he's already signed up the error as
well,

f5af12f1-f3e4-4545-94aa-7437f0a11c2e-1
00:19:07.283 --> 00:19:17.289
and the next thing to check whether is
what kind of role does the contact have,

f5af12f1-f3e4-4545-94aa-7437f0a11c2e-2
00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:18.040
right?

afbf7acd-b10f-495c-9eeb-1352194570ac-0
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.040
So I don't know whether this is going to
change as well.

7600aad0-653b-47d6-aac3-3b646f914ec0-0
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:32.793
So what it does is it cheques the
contacts web roles and it returns the set

7600aad0-653b-47d6-aac3-3b646f914ec0-1
00:19:32.793 --> 00:19:35.160
of web roles, right?

fbaee2b5-1da9-4986-8b6f-8870baa91d85-0
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:46.640
So once the web role is returned,
so we we in in our app settings.

b726195f-51af-47d2-97e8-c6173d549a88-0
00:19:48.560 --> 00:20:04.194
For example like we go to dev,
we store the the GUID of the GUID of the

b726195f-51af-47d2-97e8-c6173d549a88-1
00:20:04.194 --> 00:20:05.280
role.

1f72c1c0-3b0a-4ccb-9394-f14780cd4b9d-0
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:11.000
In in Azure.

900bf035-035e-4a29-a21e-e2b6b9a4e292-0
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:30.390
Let me put in the dev keyword.

d43b765f-a9f9-464d-a5f6-e356c9a4fe3c-0
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:46.190
So there should be no it's actually not
stored in dev keyword.

1c8877e0-5ace-4280-beba-832849b381e2-0
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:51.430
It's it's stored in the conflict file of
the API.

c428c105-bd35-418c-8dbe-51f89afada32-0
00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.280
So you can see for dev it's not showed in.

d0189f00-c10d-4791-b985-05a94e03e31f-0
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.800
So if you go to devconfig.

0aee8b04-dd6c-4812-b0fe-3ab8a899cf95-0
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.920
So that's impacted individual role ID.

8690b46c-7bf4-4720-9dee-8d112b11c422-0
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.098
So,
So what it does is it gets the web roles

8690b46c-7bf4-4720-9dee-8d112b11c422-1
00:22:14.098 --> 00:22:22.590
and check whether web role has this
contact has this role ID already assigned

8690b46c-7bf4-4720-9dee-8d112b11c422-2
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:31.516
to itself and then if it is yes then mark
the contact as impacted individual when

8690b46c-7bf4-4720-9dee-8d112b11c422-3
00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:36.960
it returns to respond to B to CB to C
would know.

fd9a9dd4-f5d6-4813-bc86-20b0a1aa2b0a-0
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.689
So if you want to have different
variations in the future so you could

fd9a9dd4-f5d6-4813-bc86-20b0a1aa2b0a-1
00:22:43.689 --> 00:22:46.520
extend extend this piece of code.

418a0826-930b-4d67-b835-32932822cd7b-0
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.998
If in future,
if if Qi team is asking for different web

418a0826-930b-4d67-b835-32932822cd7b-1
00:22:58.998 --> 00:23:02.940
role ID,
they're asking after sign in different

418a0826-930b-4d67-b835-32932822cd7b-2
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:08.360
role needs to be assigned,
then where we should go and update it?

bdd03c37-94db-4e19-afbf-faeac6c04928-0
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.440
Dev settings usually.

248dfcfb-3d4f-4f6b-a1a3-29b9ab747fd5-0
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.000
Yeah, so dev settings.

97004792-741d-40bb-861a-4c605dfc1d35-0
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.480
So the reason I mean,
I can move this back to Azure.

d854abfd-a03b-4b24-b6f3-f94cf8bd55bc-0
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:26.040
So you can see there's only configs for
dev and dev.

e2e21df4-0b83-4bd9-b4a4-bb86052d80f1-0
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.520
And because this,
because the environment is partition,

e2e21df4-0b83-4bd9-b4a4-bb86052d80f1-1
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.600
the keyboard is partition.

ee999d15-a1a4-4d4e-9b04-0e11689a25c0-0
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:40.020
So if you're using the same,
if you're using the same keyboard for two

ee999d15-a1a4-4d4e-9b04-0e11689a25c0-1
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:45.093
different environments,
so that the things that are changing are

ee999d15-a1a4-4d4e-9b04-0e11689a25c0-2
00:23:45.093 --> 00:23:47.200
moved into the config part.

b9c28b5f-44d1-47cb-9813-6b0c6f047450-0
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.322
But for other environments like test
environment, for example,

b9c28b5f-44d1-47cb-9813-6b0c6f047450-1
00:23:52.322 --> 00:23:55.280
if you go test environment,
it's in the keyword.

5e2b2ea4-3d93-48bf-a128-faf3b479343f-0
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.960
So you can find it either in the config
or in the keyword.

d5a7ae3f-b3ba-4d76-ae34-4c56c97c9820-0
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:14.200
So for example, if you go to test keyword,
that role IDs in here.

4b463252-a4fe-442f-b7a6-c2813dd86a55-0
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.160
Yeah.

92962277-76d5-40e5-84cf-ec36aa18b4bb-0
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.480
See you change it in here so you had a
new version.

881ec50c-a290-4aaa-9a60-69f1868fc683-0
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.120
Yep.

2990d385-51ea-4b0d-9701-bfc530d86825-0
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.840
But the roll that is here.

7d66dfb9-2934-4e5c-8f6e-52eda2cf9ad2-0
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.187
All right,
So this is where you're reading in your

7d66dfb9-2934-4e5c-8f6e-52eda2cf9ad2-1
00:24:27.187 --> 00:24:27.480
code.

911c1fd4-6dfb-4664-a6b5-e8c3dd43d2e6-0
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.680
You're coming here and reading the value
from here.

e6a942ab-2a4d-4107-86d2-8d1741d6d4ad-0
00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.000
And yeah, yeah.

b40a6af2-99ea-442a-a021-519f6636a78f-0
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.320
So it's so in.
net it's sort of hierarchical.

fc28801d-4fa1-4dd5-aaa3-f7ac6fab4c72-0
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.320
So it it will try to read it from here.

884ad064-8f8b-488b-9faa-625e5b2f94c5-0
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:37.960
Yep.

466816e5-111b-405b-9aa6-a2f6f715e5b3-0
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.040
If it respond,
it'll take the value from the keyword.

18aa25c2-2472-481e-bec6-774ed323f470-0
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.996
If it is not,
if the setting is not there in the

18aa25c2-2472-481e-bec6-774ed323f470-1
00:24:45.996 --> 00:24:49.480
keyword,
then you'll fall back to the settings.

b7c0fae1-244f-423c-ab12-3439d9d445b4-0
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.760
So that's what's happening in the dev.

f554c12d-ce7d-4fc8-b3c2-3914ddfe7542-0
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.280
So dev did not have that in the keyword.

a51238e3-ffd0-40ad-b82f-80022a047d0f-0
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.680
It falls back to the value in the config
file.

0de3ad6e-e433-4f82-8fd3-11a01041bd6e-0
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.880
OK, thatshowthe.net works.

89d3bc91-f8c3-4e66-8bb2-8436f42f6ea1-0
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.760
So the production and all they do have
keyword, right?

29eb908b-14e8-4cc4-a3fc-1b59e6e9254c-0
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.840
So the value will be there.

f540aadb-6cf1-41b8-8aff-d641d33d9d9b-0
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.280
Yeah, yeah, production.

e260cc40-5a15-40ae-91bb-c2b493608701-0
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.640
The value will be there because
production is not shared.

62cacf7b-994c-4913-8e6a-7e694775009a-0
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.960
So everything is coming from the keyboard.

5f7fe3d6-2d41-4738-9a0f-1dc81b5b25f8-0
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.360
So that's where there's no production app
settings here.

974db002-d99e-4a63-aebb-42817ad5c7f3-0
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.240
Yeah, production app settings for here.

635290fe-1ff9-49a7-8b1d-c315d55fc039-0
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.160
So everything will come from keyboard.

b3d9e6d1-a20b-4567-b415-9912f17b56b9-0
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.440
So have you guys decided on the roles?

ae3e81e4-3212-4bd1-8614-8383e7b269df-0
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.240
How the roles going to work?

b75d7e63-a0aa-46e1-8649-feb6dd24ca45-0
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.880
So role is like when the EOI submitted is
for RMA.

74cd6e7c-0c68-4d34-8ec6-41a377db29aa-0
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.706
So the role will be assigned when the
contact,

74cd6e7c-0c68-4d34-8ec6-41a377db29aa-1
00:25:38.706 --> 00:25:41.473
the invitation sent before invitation
itself,

74cd6e7c-0c68-4d34-8ec6-41a377db29aa-2
00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:44.000
the role will be assigned to the contract.

4b52a928-944b-4875-89e0-9d2d2a6b594b-0
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.760
That's what my understanding so far.

40b98382-7163-49e3-8ccf-8dc6ab1645a5-0
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.760
But we need to confirm with Jamie again.

668a227b-d32d-4d46-8a33-0a8d327d8725-0
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.538
So the question is,
so there are web roles,

668a227b-d32d-4d46-8a33-0a8d327d8725-1
00:25:53.538 --> 00:25:56.720
right And there are organisation roles,
right?

178ab874-42ee-494c-b5b5-ee29576362ff-0
00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.920
So where organisation roles will be?

80e97c29-8f26-4c83-8bd7-4b57f5acd450-0
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.661
So for my understanding,
we have contact and we have account,

80e97c29-8f26-4c83-8bd7-4b57f5acd450-1
00:26:04.661 --> 00:26:05.120
right?

eff544ad-8340-4078-b2ac-015d6c4c1947-0
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.920
And there's a link between the contact
and the account, right?

b1435531-ea79-4300-ac93-4c9a075e6ff8-0
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.080
Yeah, we have a middle table.

9e1286d1-f646-4259-8337-6a3196180ded-0
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.800
We are designing that, yeah, yeah.

29fea220-8bc6-40b4-816b-d0b50ded1b04-0
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.400
And so the the the role will be in that,
for example, if you want to find out.

4757ef82-ec29-4a76-accc-9e52923ea69f-0
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:25.683
So I think,
so where I'm trying to go is I think Josh

4757ef82-ec29-4a76-accc-9e52923ea69f-1
00:26:25.683 --> 00:26:36.080
mentioned that he wanted to do additional
code if the CEO is signing up additional

4757ef82-ec29-4a76-accc-9e52923ea69f-2
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.840
code, RTO code, I'm not aware of that.

cdcdf84f-afdc-4f83-9542-b9456310f54b-0
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.480
No DNA, No,
you haven't been told about that then?

d5162a08-5fd1-42a6-927f-f68ecc717c1e-0
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.942
No, so far, no,
you guys were in that sign up meeting,

d5162a08-5fd1-42a6-927f-f68ecc717c1e-1
00:26:46.942 --> 00:26:47.320
right.

b0836811-53f1-4569-977c-1125e1f4c38f-0
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:54.320
So remember that there was 3 branches in
Abby's sign up floor, right?

0340b11a-9c99-4452-8473-8dc45190d7eb-0
00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:04.089
So one was the impacting individual,
the other was the normal RTORTO and there

0340b11a-9c99-4452-8473-8dc45190d7eb-1
00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:07.800
was a CEO is there were three.

17c15e1b-6c6b-43aa-a9f9-9b90c236f728-0
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.120
I don't think that's still in discussion.

ef344a80-d3f8-418e-a9a9-bb1dcbdf0f7d-0
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.480
It's not finalised.

82d9275b-2010-470c-b844-e8f9a0c995e1-0
00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:18.240
I think going forward it will be 1 sign
up kind of stuff.

41d8db86-0f30-40eb-b6a0-3355337a6dd3-0
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.907
So when the UI submitted,
ask or approve it and then the role will

41d8db86-0f30-40eb-b6a0-3355337a6dd3-1
00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:24.560
be assigned the back end.

58c3021d-e9ab-4de9-9db4-2da23cccfcef-0
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.557
Yeah, when the invitation sent,
then when user logged it,

58c3021d-e9ab-4de9-9db4-2da23cccfcef-1
00:27:28.557 --> 00:27:33.520
whoever is coming like admin or CEO,
both are going to share the same web role.

883fafe8-9e04-4926-a2f8-40a91b99d362-0
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.160
That's what Josh said.

cb1dc45a-eeec-474d-9d82-22cc1594cc1b-0
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.160
And then that admin will take care of
other roles.

55ee36b5-0ab9-48f2-a606-643f03288eeb-0
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.519
They we are designing your profiling page
so they can add a contact and the role

55ee36b5-0ab9-48f2-a606-643f03288eeb-1
00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:44.080
specific role to the contact.

83e65da4-05d1-4ab4-bcc3-20685204229f-0
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.800
That's the plan for example.

a45d47be-5441-4b87-bfdd-dfa647a87d64-0
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.840
So there's admin role and there's CEO
role, right?

5096ca47-3235-4078-b8ce-10cc858f369c-0
00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.360
Both same, both same.

531a8a3d-1d2f-4930-a05b-f33ec24ad15c-0
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.120
Now there is no admin specific role, OK,
Yeah.

9b19e304-5db8-485f-8323-56e7a84d1d46-0
00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.880
So admin is like the role probably CEO
force under it, right.

a6927dcc-a93c-4b89-a3b6-4dd41c37732b-0
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.680
Is there no CEO, admin both same.

762bbbd8-0858-4ee9-88bb-b02ccf585642-0
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.200
There is no admin role at all now.

303e562d-0eb2-4115-bd0e-3ee868068559-0
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.240
So CEO is going to be admin.

ff0cf314-a634-4643-9ee5-6876ac1d0c4f-0
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.845
We are not creating any specific
convention is different than Oka CEO is

ff0cf314-a634-4643-9ee5-6876ac1d0c4f-1
00:28:11.845 --> 00:28:14.480
like as you said is the organisation role,
right.

ed9688c2-ed75-4167-849b-46a15ca7e9f4-0
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.053
As a contact CEO will have a web role
which will be named differently which is

ed9688c2-ed75-4167-849b-46a15ca7e9f4-1
00:28:19.053 --> 00:28:20.280
not administrator role.

cba48eee-3cc2-453b-aa87-8d9f453fdade-0
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.425
Yeah,
so it is delegate 3 level role or the

cba48eee-3cc2-453b-aa87-8d9f453fdade-1
00:28:23.425 --> 00:28:24.600
something like that.

5ef77fc4-2676-4ed0-8d01-e5694504f5a5-0
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.080
I think there is a sheet.

ffe20ab9-f208-4e5d-a049-014b0e023d33-0
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:26.920
Yeah.

503f18c1-86af-42f7-bdb3-c1bbd46f749d-0
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.920
So what what are the organisation roles
about?

019264d4-de11-4c56-93a1-b9b9c57bd08f-0
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.800
What are the list of organisation roles?

78c4d6fb-c63f-4342-8ea9-d0ac98a47ad5-0
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:41.427
There is I think the you and governing
persons are there so that those roles are

78c4d6fb-c63f-4342-8ea9-d0ac98a47ad5-1
00:28:41.427 --> 00:28:43.000
specific to the pages.

1d736334-8f95-48d9-931d-067b742c852d-0
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.070
So not like a database side,
it's web role,

1d736334-8f95-48d9-931d-067b742c852d-1
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:51.120
those are power pages side access level
rules.

2473d8eb-0c66-4072-afc7-db1d05fbb45c-0
00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.280
So governing person only see these two
pages.

8dd5752a-118c-4134-8993-4aac472a75da-0
00:28:54.280 --> 00:29:00.211
So PUC only dashboard something like that
we are designing it's nothing to do with

8dd5752a-118c-4134-8993-4aac472a75da-1
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:06.000
this data was side or only the portal
side, all other rules, organisation rules.

779f5978-5a14-477c-8b42-91a36aa62e0c-0
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.040
OK, yeah.

90b187aa-8322-424a-83d5-e09836b4605c-0
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:16.308
So anyway,
so the role is checked against web role

90b187aa-8322-424a-83d5-e09836b4605c-1
00:29:16.308 --> 00:29:16.800
now.

caf9280d-a0cd-4a4e-8a8a-9da8b017b5f1-0
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.071
So if you wanted to change,
if there's any requirement, yeah,

caf9280d-a0cd-4a4e-8a8a-9da8b017b5f1-1
00:29:21.071 --> 00:29:23.000
this is the place to modify.

44dcd658-47fd-4c99-9ec4-8e8cf452b25d-0
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.491
So as I explained,
it reads the web roles table for the

44dcd658-47fd-4c99-9ec4-8e8cf452b25d-1
00:29:30.491 --> 00:29:38.414
contact and check whether the Rd matches
and sort of let BDC know whether this is

44dcd658-47fd-4c99-9ec4-8e8cf452b25d-2
00:29:38.414 --> 00:29:41.120
impacting individual, right.

3054ce24-87a9-48c7-a976-9167b635f77e-0
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:47.360
So let's go back to here,
just one question.

8b06bbe7-1849-47da-875a-9fd6c403ace5-0
00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:52.141
Why did you say that we are maintaining
this role ID in app setting for dev

8b06bbe7-1849-47da-875a-9fd6c403ace5-1
00:29:52.141 --> 00:29:53.400
instead of keyboard?

2aca5477-dbe9-41ff-824b-c130cf9a5a5b-0
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:02.328
Because it the the keyboard is
partitioned in dev between dev and dev

2aca5477-dbe9-41ff-824b-c130cf9a5a5b-1
00:30:02.328 --> 00:30:08.680
and dev and OK, So from my understanding,
the role ID remains same, right?

40cb1772-8bfe-4084-84d2-fc7b7fefb9df-0
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.920
So it won't change from environment to
environment.

18a0caac-a0b7-44e1-9025-177916370514-0
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.320
Yeah, yeah.

2ef4191b-8764-47fb-b79d-9063429ae03e-0
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:22.949
But I think I kept the IT can be moved
back to he would but but there are some

2ef4191b-8764-47fb-b79d-9063429ae03e-1
00:30:22.949 --> 00:30:31.320
other settings in dev are different from
dev into dev environment.

dd5f34e0-aa23-40f2-8acb-12158c887cc4-0
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:40.736
For example the scope and the the base
URL they will be changed or kept the role

dd5f34e0-aa23-40f2-8acb-12158c887cc4-1
00:30:40.736 --> 00:30:42.480
ID key as well.

c03934b0-6adc-4d04-8ebd-925e8821e931-0
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:55.369
But because since it's not changing you
can move it back to keyword if needed so

c03934b0-6adc-4d04-8ebd-925e8821e931-1
00:30:55.369 --> 00:31:02.960
so you can see so this is what the API
returns.

04152be9-0a93-4f69-a4a5-f6f555a8cc00-0
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:08.761
API returns the contact ID, full name,
first name,

04152be9-0a93-4f69-a4a5-f6f555a8cc00-1
00:31:08.761 --> 00:31:13.880
last name and is impacted individual,
right?

ceedee23-31d6-4e46-9861-19b473e46dae-0
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.440
So if you look for the user job is
impacted individual.

d333d202-430d-43b0-88c4-242a9e147a47-0
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.680
Yeah, verification.

8855b868-0663-49d5-b962-3f25162085a0-0
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:36.918
So you can see when signing up,
say if impacted individual,

8855b868-0663-49d5-b962-3f25162085a0-1
00:31:36.918 --> 00:31:45.080
if not impacted individual,
then do use the sign up.

08585d9b-e6fc-422e-9c4b-e28dd50688ee-0
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:55.328
If it is impacted individual,
then use the impacted individual sign up

08585d9b-e6fc-422e-9c4b-e28dd50688ee-1
00:31:55.328 --> 00:31:58.600
to do you spread folks right.

6daf9267-b42f-4d12-b89d-9e6c6cffb7d8-0
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.540
So if you in case I don't know whether
you're going to have it,

6daf9267-b42f-4d12-b89d-9e6c6cffb7d8-1
00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.120
you can sort of use the same pattern.

b52403e7-0ee1-46ed-b1c8-92071b68b6ee-0
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.955
If you have like another flavour of sign
up,

b52403e7-0ee1-46ed-b1c8-92071b68b6ee-1
00:32:13.955 --> 00:32:23.120
then you check the role and return what
the role is is whatever, ECO, whatever.

b29db6cc-f671-44e7-8852-315dde944a12-0
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.520
And you can use the same method if it is.

eed7eea2-15c9-47ea-9ca3-42fcb636de4e-0
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:41.032
So you can sort of have this conditional
sort of sign ups in in your user journey

eed7eea2-15c9-47ea-9ca3-42fcb636de4e-1
00:32:41.032 --> 00:32:51.469
to show differently for for example,
if you go to impacted individual sign up,

eed7eea2-15c9-47ea-9ca3-42fcb636de4e-2
00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:54.640
you have all this right?

d3ba2881-c0ce-4823-8f12-3ced837ff823-0
00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:00.840
So you have the date of birth,
you have the RN likewise.

68d98561-c4cc-4f43-868e-b4d8d0347115-0
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.484
But if you go back to,
I don't think I have the generic sign up

68d98561-c4cc-4f43-868e-b4d8d0347115-1
00:33:08.484 --> 00:33:12.320
yet, but but I think it's a different one.

1be8222c-f668-4379-9145-4974dba34b9f-0
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.160
Yeah, it's,
it's just a vanilla one that it uses.

21bd6e40-2966-4df2-b85d-8a4be118f021-0
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:26.308
So if I go to for example,
if I go back to SO it uses the vanilla

21bd6e40-2966-4df2-b85d-8a4be118f021-1
00:33:26.308 --> 00:33:31.528
one,
but I need to configure it properly to

21bd6e40-2966-4df2-b85d-8a4be118f021-2
00:33:31.528 --> 00:33:35.679
use sort of like the Ascot sign up.

207c9489-064f-45fc-9a99-05dc4650b5d3-0
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:45.760
They have.

f4322246-e3b0-4ae4-9635-7d80cef112ef-0
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.090
They are in.

5f0f9663-c571-4753-bba0-f26c2125162d-0
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:23.080
Sign up, close the apps,
but then go to make all apps.

1b61dcc5-4169-483c-86ba-a03299a07ec8-0
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:52.940
So if I go to contacts table, yeah.

246357a5-2f92-44d3-a342-13045234cec2-0
00:34:53.060 --> 00:35:06.656
So this one Binnuka 41,
it should not have impacted individual

246357a5-2f92-44d3-a342-13045234cec2-1
00:35:06.656 --> 00:35:07.520
row.

40fc4f8b-5ccb-4c1d-a16c-1a9eed174f0b-0
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:24.925
So if I use this contact ID,
so this link will open up when we click

40fc4f8b-5ccb-4c1d-a16c-1a9eed174f0b-1
00:35:24.925 --> 00:35:32.190
on the invitation being sent.

29335302-a783-42cc-8a03-dd0e189a4d17-0
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:39.643
Is it it'll it will redirect me to the
the page that you showed me previously,

29335302-a783-42cc-8a03-dd0e189a4d17-1
00:35:39.643 --> 00:35:40.870
the ARN page.

b8a7f892-5987-41c7-b832-8c77faee0352-0
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:41.390
Yeah.

84f00e80-482b-4c27-b3f3-f47d6cae5b92-0
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:43.750
So it's not configured right.

7e58d2ee-901f-4ee1-b96e-8f58d314e4ff-0
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:52.448
So currently in dev 01 portal points to
the impact in individual sign in sign up

7e58d2ee-901f-4ee1-b96e-8f58d314e4ff-1
00:35:52.448 --> 00:35:53.200
policy.

df9e291a-5219-46d6-9061-af19a3582898-0
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.160
Yeah, yeah.

9df6b6c1-15af-4e90-aecd-504cbe2f5c77-0
00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.120
Was that your question?

92d1a6b9-664a-4a6f-9670-0072b5ec3842-0
00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.600
No, I'm just asking.

3bf3c579-44fb-4af2-9187-a45d1e83c01c-0
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.320
So you are designing this sign up right
now for the RMA.

0043655d-f1b8-42fe-a9ae-3a12dc6abb2c-0
00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.282
So when a when when a when a contact gets
the invitation and clicks on the link,

0043655d-f1b8-42fe-a9ae-3a12dc6abb2c-1
00:36:08.282 --> 00:36:12.080
they should be displayed with this ARN
page so that they can enter.

f87a845b-e781-4eb6-b019-3eb47bf68da5-0
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.790
And from then on they will be guided
towards the sign up process or the

f87a845b-e781-4eb6-b019-3eb47bf68da5-1
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:18.360
initial sign up process.

d12dd6a7-595f-4bd0-9640-8b41b6f1a2e6-0
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:22.280
I'm just asking when I click on the link,
will they be redirected to the ARM page?

31d4f1fe-ebd8-48a4-91b7-817956806fce-0
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:32.040
So, So what will happen is in the email,
you will have a portal URL.

b3b7a141-5c38-4655-bf0c-0ab02c761200-0
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.240
OK yeah.

badcea60-0ad5-4aea-91f2-329b5bdbac44-0
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.120
From there they will click and then come
to.

09047e38-bc7d-4a57-90bc-bd0e13379bed-0
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.520
OK yeah.

a317ad97-6614-4c45-a913-2ce039c64ab6-0
00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.240
So so so this is the piece that we need
to work on, right?

b7866e05-85e9-4ef5-8aec-0750aaa1a38f-0
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.560
OK, so so so in the.

e941fcc6-0e2b-47aa-a089-2c121f74187d-0
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.200
In here, OK.

b1057265-1d87-4d4d-acc0-dd6703660f09-0
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:51.480
Yeah.

45b8f803-f976-4ae7-9d02-7f1494288404-0
00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.440
So in here, Yeah, we have sign in, right.

3ecdeb0a-af97-4207-a994-a13718012cdd-0
00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.000
OK.

e3b38392-dc87-469c-9e2b-5736f052ae3a-0
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.760
Does she have sign in here sign up?

371b45a2-bee6-4855-bf57-2fdff422db07-0
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.880
So we have these questions, right?

a03e7fcc-90a5-4d54-b3c1-5d9ed427c260-0
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.080
OK.

c7f87cdc-8a15-47a1-8f11-a9fd925c2d59-0
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:05.720
Yeah.

05c134fd-217c-4258-a349-dc4dfb4bb554-0
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.160
So this is the sign up sort of from the
portal.

0e79bc02-971a-42bd-aef9-6c44d9feb9ea-0
00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:10.320
OK.

6b7a83c8-560e-41ad-b318-bfde5307775e-0
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:19.240
So in this case, yes, we don't need to So,
so if they're coming from email, yeah.

8cceeca2-8d19-4c6e-9b54-c4dfc4e2d030-0
00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.400
So this is this is what what you guys
need to figure out, right?

40ed614d-2000-471d-aeaa-f361052b5f9c-0
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:28.312
So if they're coming from the email,
that email will have linked to RTO

40ed614d-2000-471d-aeaa-f361052b5f9c-1
00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:30.560
dashboard, for example, right?

7fae98b4-fc55-4f7b-85b3-f79d9e5f4e02-0
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.800
Yeah, right.

4e352dc0-b521-44fd-b6f2-79784af610a8-0
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:40.240
So, so, so,
so you guys need to figure out a way that

4e352dc0-b521-44fd-b6f2-79784af610a8-1
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:47.960
when that page is hit, Yeah,
not to show this, right.

c64f2d5a-1cd7-4de9-bbec-9094e0f8cd56-0
00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.640
So there's no need to show because they
already have ARN, right?

b9e40051-03f5-425a-b539-66462c2eb2a6-0
00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.720
They're coming from ARN.

988dcaab-d018-4deb-bd56-8917443b8c36-0
00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:58.040
They didn't they know that they need to
be redirected to RTO dashboard, right?

7c9cb708-3b5b-42e7-8eb0-96babc68d57a-0
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:58.720
Yeah.

c11ad7a8-1c91-4b84-9eab-5055fe93fc0d-0
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.920
So instead of asking this you,
they should land here directly.

7ba41801-0bdd-4bce-90b4-c5169a5cb325-0
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:15.360
So so I think what you guys probably need
to do is that use that.

bc93c4bb-9d7f-4f84-bf36-2f1fbabe562b-0
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.920
So there's sign button, sign in button,
right?

e3b046eb-e6c3-4d1c-94d6-693c9d8e6092-0
00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.882
Yeah, yeah,
sign in button sort of have a sign in

e3b046eb-e6c3-4d1c-94d6-693c9d8e6092-1
00:38:24.882 --> 00:38:28.000
Page in BTC, so not BTC in portal, right.

6ff887bb-fde5-4b37-adee-81ffeb237c4a-0
00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.160
Yeah.

80fab397-019b-49f6-a811-a81518cf11d7-0
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.600
And use that sign in Page.

90c2a349-fc22-4f05-a458-f36c70d871d2-0
00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:39.137
Sign up page have some sort of JavaScript
logic to figure out Yeah,

90c2a349-fc22-4f05-a458-f36c70d871d2-1
00:38:39.137 --> 00:38:43.600
this is redirected from so there's a
referral.

5cf0b972-6820-4957-983c-d061dd204908-0
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:50.439
So when when it's get redirected,
always the request have a referral header,

5cf0b972-6820-4957-983c-d061dd204908-1
00:38:50.439 --> 00:38:50.960
right.

d46e4e1d-adfc-44f6-8fa6-cfb067f3cbdf-0
00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.856
So if that refer is header is there,
then don't show the sign in sign up this

d46e4e1d-adfc-44f6-8fa6-cfb067f3cbdf-1
00:38:56.856 --> 00:38:58.520
this page here, right.

ec1b02eb-1b16-4b10-ace9-9ece1114c849-0
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.880
Don't show this page.

1b5f01d9-09f6-4d6f-a962-9a4d2341d265-0
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:09.315
Yeah, just go directly to B to C OK,
So we have that option also the sign up

1b5f01d9-09f6-4d6f-a962-9a4d2341d265-1
00:39:09.315 --> 00:39:16.707
option also where the user can click on
sign up or they have an option to click

1b5f01d9-09f6-4d6f-a962-9a4d2341d265-2
00:39:16.707 --> 00:39:19.480
from the invitation link also.

a5c7bad5-9774-4b15-864d-a668a6b1e9d6-0
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.760
Yeah, there will be a invitation email.

1567abca-86cd-487b-879d-c83247482c3e-0
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.440
Yeah, for sure.

0dda53a8-cde2-4552-9040-264bcb065d1f-0
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:25.840
Right.

22e8a0c7-f478-43f3-be03-cc2a17840a10-0
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.560
So that's how they're gonna get their
ring, right.

6f894702-0cdd-4d1e-81aa-8775293f28dd-0
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:35.548
So, but we, we can get them here,
but there's a additional click for the

6f894702-0cdd-4d1e-81aa-8775293f28dd-1
00:39:35.548 --> 00:39:39.760
user to which they don't need to do,
right.

30efc88b-572a-4f07-9def-f749d81de16c-0
00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.000
So maybe you guys can we have to discuss
on that.

8cfdb5ca-159f-45e7-a1fe-af44668a4792-0
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.040
I think the first thing, yeah,
you need to discuss on that.

635e32b8-46f9-421b-a4eb-5e09b0d92751-0
00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.848
But I,
I think are you guys already working on

635e32b8-46f9-421b-a4eb-5e09b0d92751-1
00:39:52.848 --> 00:39:55.920
this like how the navigation would work?

ff25b54a-4119-4366-a568-5dc6101acad6-0
00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.040
Not yet, yeah,
we haven't finalised on that yet, I think.

2dad1eb3-8bd3-4893-aa5b-450afbba6190-0
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.400
Yeah, OK.

6a57ddfe-e6d0-460a-9c50-35796f7fd01a-0
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.812
But but you guys need to get familiarised
with how the navigation should work,

6a57ddfe-e6d0-460a-9c50-35796f7fd01a-1
00:40:07.812 --> 00:40:08.160
right?

8d153585-b923-492c-871d-773cb47365ab-0
00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.880
How the navigation should work.

7654cdb5-8e93-44ff-87d5-1c9595a3c281-0
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.800
And for for different entry point,
the user experience could be different.

c0bd2053-3522-4953-a1fc-0563a8a3e29e-0
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.560
That's cool.

39f353cc-9187-478e-abfe-61f0353aa0a5-0
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.000
What else?

b17498ef-082f-4e25-837c-77d83fee3588-0
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.000
That That's pretty much the RMA stuff.

c969caaa-e333-47b3-827e-0a045e9d8c02-0
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:35.880
Yeah.

3a5ca71b-cf24-47c6-a0e9-f8510a38808b-0
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.320
So I'll,
I'll what I'll do is I'll clean up.

b6e00576-7ca5-4c59-8262-e5c3e8412718-0
00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:44.857
So,
so this should not have first these these

b6e00576-7ca5-4c59-8262-e5c3e8412718-1
00:40:44.857 --> 00:40:45.800
columns.

bf7be8d1-4194-48ce-8848-818866c10062-0
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:58.232
Instead they what they should have is
just pretty much I think what should have

bf7be8d1-4194-48ce-8848-818866c10062-1
00:40:58.232 --> 00:41:04.760
is just email address password, that's it.

ad2148a3-4cfb-4ec5-95ae-d21ca7914156-0
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.160
I think let's make a change now.

ab640028-613f-4cc4-937d-5db8fa0b28c0-0
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.240
Do you guys have some sort of experience?

1eb23c56-522a-4f53-bed6-1f848ec63a17-0
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:22.480
So here so impacted individual.

7ffa3af7-3cfd-40ee-afeb-eeea503e4e21-0
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.040
We don't want to touch that.

7f783bdd-b9d4-431c-9d25-a07fb114091f-0
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.680
So I have something called new user.

b2a64d35-94bb-4d3c-9393-54528bed1ed0-0
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.690
So I don't want the first name,
last name to be displayed when you use

b2a64d35-94bb-4d3c-9393-54528bed1ed0-1
00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:44.080
this.

0da7faa4-03bd-4945-a7f8-cd29b47aa370-0
00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:52.040
I'll take it off Password,
New password re entered is required.

e2f37e03-ddd8-4804-bdb5-9921159f6833-0
00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.360
Execute service input shows new user.

d5f7a6e0-6844-4e95-9108-3b3bd53979a1-0
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:11.680
That's all required, yeah,
bearer token contact, that's all needed.

1aa0c5a4-7370-4fe6-97ba-feaa2a37ac67-0
00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:20.784
So if,
if I change this now and I need to use

1aa0c5a4-7370-4fe6-97ba-feaa2a37ac67-1
00:42:20.784 --> 00:42:22.440
that, right?

874b982a-d018-4504-9b7c-6626d97dbf18-0
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:31.080
So, so in that user journey,
go back to user journey.

1e044952-efef-41f5-baca-cc32408f1b20-0
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.080
So this instead of using this,
they should use the new user.

e61a7b36-36dc-4678-bbe6-12baec1b4d87-0
00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:56.925
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
compile this and I'm going to deploy the

e61a7b36-36dc-4678-bbe6-12baec1b4d87-1
00:42:56.925 --> 00:42:58.800
policy and.

45b125d8-5555-40de-a119-b5093bc654bb-0
00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:19.840
Once stick load,
so if I go back so every time you test

45b125d8-5555-40de-a119-b5093bc654bb-1
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:26.920
you come to the that policy so dev and
you can run now.

1615fdf2-69ff-4436-87b4-2983a569dbd0-0
00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.600
So sometimes BTC does caching.

58ce2601-045d-491f-aec1-10442d29b5d5-0
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:38.040
So it's that's why always should go there
and start if I get the contact ID again.

ccbce6db-c69c-4dce-aeec-0ce99397cfef-0
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:58.480
Yeah, resource should the audio sign up.

95df166d-8350-43e7-95bf-b3116f12aef7-0
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.880
So we've asked for the ARN.

7a0f51af-ddd4-4a97-9194-c6bf3adbeaac-0
00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:08.520
So you verify email address,
password and then sign up.

db2c9dc7-467b-458f-9301-8b164f8a1e96-0
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:19.093
So I'll,
I'll leave the RMA in this state working

db2c9dc7-467b-458f-9301-8b164f8a1e96-1
00:44:19.093 --> 00:44:20.760
reworking.

0695ca33-67c1-4236-b0bf-0c3986a3f0c6-0
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:31.382
You can go all the way to complete sign
up and the modifications that you need to

0695ca33-67c1-4236-b0bf-0c3986a3f0c6-1
00:44:31.382 --> 00:44:41.746
do is change the API to use a different
field to validate the array here in the

0695ca33-67c1-4236-b0bf-0c3986a3f0c6-2
00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:43.560
verify method.

f4a423d1-3f39-4b56-8733-b1422eaea759-0
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:53.155
And then also if there any changes to
role design and make those role changes

f4a423d1-3f39-4b56-8733-b1422eaea759-1
00:44:53.155 --> 00:44:56.000
here, then RMA should be ready.

e202b057-9707-4375-8e6c-ef97f66833d8-0
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:01.360
Yep.

4b311c7d-5490-4070-9eba-cf4eae40a1a1-0
00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.000
Is the site back?

e2b2ab72-e01b-4ece-9050-5c17b38acf19-0
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.360
Can we do not yet?

df4ad531-daee-42a7-a7cf-7750a710f9b1-0
00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:13.320
Not yet still and it's still, yeah,
in progress.

8c336380-56d1-41fe-b854-2a82d6b01838-0
00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.000
I don't think so.

bd60a202-71df-40db-82e8-7825264884b3-0
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.800
It will be all right.

175ef5eb-7f24-4e36-a424-e676c3558701-0
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:24.920
So meanwhile then let's have a look at
the 100 point ID check.

6f51bf46-845f-4f4f-9aca-79f73d211456-0
00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:31.320
So there's another branch called Google.

6478d770-b668-4b3b-a5e4-6e1754b8a014-0
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:43.840
So let's see what the changes find Google.

8c5c4815-b62f-419c-892c-6592ecd5306a-0
00:45:47.560 --> 00:46:02.400
So there should be another policy, Yeah,
just want to do compare to Google.

da8f78a0-8f7e-4f53-b785-e84c19d1413f-0
00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:17.757
So this is going back to that simulation
that you don't you guys wanted to have

da8f78a0-8f7e-4f53-b785-e84c19d1413f-1
00:46:17.757 --> 00:46:30.342
right 400 point ID check yes RTO sign up
trying to recall myself what I what I've

da8f78a0-8f7e-4f53-b785-e84c19d1413f-2
00:46:30.342 --> 00:46:31.110
done.

9206f7af-6a35-4c1a-9bc6-783a2c13e839-0
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:37.630
I know this identity proofing is the
policy.

58994a27-1fe9-49fb-afa8-f7faf5cd3b6b-0
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:51.373
So if I go to the dev,
there should be a policy called identity

58994a27-1fe9-49fb-afa8-f7faf5cd3b6b-1
00:46:51.373 --> 00:46:53.160
proofing.

10cffc90-98b0-4a39-870b-687fb3cb7692-0
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:04.860
So let's try run this and see what
happens.

15bdae82-9591-4c42-998b-b99717f3a83c-0
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:21.010
Yeah, you need to log in first.

67124e26-5dc1-4dcd-97ec-b50bf8b67f44-0
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:29.490
So let's remind ourselves what 100 point
ID is.

cf051d1d-8581-4eb6-a370-3c63e738ebfb-0
00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:32.290
Let me open up V-0.

5c04c927-fcdf-489f-8c44-3999ebef94e8-0
00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:02.130
100 point ID verification.

fbb1e04a-f5f4-4ad7-a125-69847fdb8b39-0
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.450
So you guys are familiar with this stuff,
right?

88d2b5ad-f5a8-41fc-ae73-dbf8e7251c9d-0
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:10.970
So you sign in or sign up,
you land on the portal.

a28b2d72-5db7-4f78-86b0-12c98df456ae-0
00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:19.862
I think So what we discussed in the UPI
planning is we're not going to make the

a28b2d72-5db7-4f78-86b0-12c98df456ae-1
00:48:19.862 --> 00:48:22.570
ID verification mandatory.

bf6bbefb-1cb1-4bfa-9da7-17f2453d0880-0
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:32.582
So they can so in stock days they should
land on the whatever the page that they

bf6bbefb-1cb1-4bfa-9da7-17f2453d0880-1
00:48:32.582 --> 00:48:34.560
need to land on.

212d7a64-dcce-496b-9dde-d7286c0bdc1b-0
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.913
If it is a governing person and that
person will see some functionality,

212d7a64-dcce-496b-9dde-d7286c0bdc1b-1
00:48:40.913 --> 00:48:45.449
they they should be able to execute some
functionality,

212d7a64-dcce-496b-9dde-d7286c0bdc1b-2
00:48:45.449 --> 00:48:47.960
but some they won't be able to.

42d8f8f0-1f94-4882-8122-984ee9306f35-0
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:54.520
And according to what you guys mentioned
before, they in the profile,

42d8f8f0-1f94-4882-8122-984ee9306f35-1
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.520
there's there's a button, right?

4361d308-c28a-49ba-8357-be15cfd0ff8f-0
00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.320
Yeah, yeah.

b0ea85ac-b6e2-4df9-9b5d-15a99ec307f2-0
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:03.320
So when that button is hit,
this flow is going to start, right.

ed39e3e6-ec07-4edc-90f2-02237648a12c-0
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:10.477
So when when the that button is hit,
the portal need to redirect user to that

ed39e3e6-ec07-4edc-90f2-02237648a12c-1
00:49:10.477 --> 00:49:11.120
policy.

37334397-0713-4ac8-8e60-e43d3c05e913-0
00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.000
I was showing RND proofing policy.

40c614bb-0c2c-4d41-8db5-b01e7b375b9f-0
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:27.178
So then RND proofing carries out so,
so I don't have this has standard digital

40c614bb-0c2c-4d41-8db5-b01e7b375b9f-1
00:49:27.178 --> 00:49:30.320
ID on BTC policy yet.

ec2004f8-a908-450f-bc3b-03c571a393be-0
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.640
So instead so there's two options, right.

de062e69-ca51-4ffb-b6eb-c9640550d076-0
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:42.983
So one option is if,
if the user has standard digital ID,

de062e69-ca51-4ffb-b6eb-c9640550d076-1
00:49:42.983 --> 00:49:49.873
good digital ID and if if they don't,
then there could be two,

de062e69-ca51-4ffb-b6eb-c9640550d076-2
00:49:49.873 --> 00:49:55.560
two links pretty much with the question
at the top.

443107e3-961a-4f1d-935a-facbccdb3471-0
00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.643
If you have a standard ID ID,
click on this,

443107e3-961a-4f1d-935a-facbccdb3471-1
00:50:01.643 --> 00:50:04.760
then go redirect them to my ID.

8097c2c7-1dfa-4620-80a6-b4433e1aa185-0
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.400
If it is not, there's a secondary process.

4bea8b4f-2420-4a10-995b-92a70fe8f4d5-0
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:14.660
So we we don't know what the secondary
service is yet, but yeah,

4bea8b4f-2420-4a10-995b-92a70fe8f4d5-1
00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.360
that's in the future.

7fb6aeb6-e681-41ac-8995-9df2d83e6e0c-0
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:25.842
And then so ID provider will ask for the
consent from the user and then has a

7fb6aeb6-e681-41ac-8995-9df2d83e6e0c-1
00:50:25.842 --> 00:50:30.921
digital ID and save that information into
B to C,

7fb6aeb6-e681-41ac-8995-9df2d83e6e0c-2
00:50:30.921 --> 00:50:39.047
save that information to database so B to
C can do that and then return back to

7fb6aeb6-e681-41ac-8995-9df2d83e6e0c-3
00:50:39.047 --> 00:50:42.400
return back to the portal, right?

1211074c-c07b-456f-b506-8e29a2a490ff-0
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:52.560
So, so instead of my ID,
what I've done is I've configured Google.

b69fce27-929d-4718-83de-c8b5c7489320-0
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:58.683
So you guys,
meantime we're getting the information to

b69fce27-929d-4718-83de-c8b5c7489320-1
00:50:58.683 --> 00:51:03.120
integration information from Service
Australia.

50e2db10-637e-41a6-8109-6ce57c9b713c-0
00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.200
We can continue to use Google.

c7bf5939-d2b4-4f47-9967-9721b317f7c4-0
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:20.880
So I think I have a user so I can
hopefully restore working.

63135f1c-5929-4da2-9600-1168fd878d63-0
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.200
So I log in.

6177061c-f0fe-42b2-9060-80c1a14e40dd-0
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:31.912
Oh,
let me check whether that I've already is

6177061c-f0fe-42b2-9060-80c1a14e40dd-1
00:51:31.912 --> 00:51:32.280
so.

e67da919-2c86-4b37-82dc-0452ff92a5da-0
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:40.330
So all the other thing that you may
wanted to know is so if you log into the

e67da919-2c86-4b37-82dc-0452ff92a5da-1
00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:47.961
ID, if you log into the B to C tenant,
so if you click on the users tab,

e67da919-2c86-4b37-82dc-0452ff92a5da-2
00:51:47.961 --> 00:51:50.680
you can see all the users.

ab621746-dc3b-4201-8d8d-fe6fae501759-0
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.440
For example,
you can search by email address.

850fd033-7052-4dd6-85ae-3e1c6690a7f8-0
00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:14.830
Yeah,
so it has multiple so I've only users.

be79368b-1695-4f84-986a-6cd772eb58f7-0
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:21.710
So what this does is it adds the Google
as the secondary identification.

ab6a7ac6-bc2a-4e96-b3b8-2b2efe209692-0
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:27.265
So if you go to the so you can click on
the users,

ab6a7ac6-bc2a-4e96-b3b8-2b2efe209692-1
00:52:27.265 --> 00:52:35.761
you can see the properties of the user
accounting B to C So this verification

ab6a7ac6-bc2a-4e96-b3b8-2b2efe209692-2
00:52:35.761 --> 00:52:36.960
then occur.

9a772b61-2e5b-4026-ab11-3c5813e4667f-0
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.576
It's like when you log in with your
Google ID,

9a772b61-2e5b-4026-ab11-3c5813e4667f-1
00:52:39.576 --> 00:52:42.360
the prompt that we get it is something
like that.

1282a57e-866a-459b-9add-e9b33adfc520-0
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.557
Verify it as you or something,
and then you click on South and this will

1282a57e-866a-459b-9add-e9b33adfc520-1
00:52:45.557 --> 00:52:46.120
authenticate.

a6364523-08c5-4e4c-9f2b-f119dbcccde9-0
00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:46.480
Is it?

5cd3af03-2b4c-43d9-8cc0-71e9be16343d-0
00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.600
Yeah, OK, yeah.

626bf2ab-1aa3-4b1f-ad4b-fde5a0c1a1fc-0
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:55.280
So so AB to C will get the user to log in
with my ID, right.

6378e511-c58e-4576-a58d-a38007de2b31-0
00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:01.687
So once it but when we asked them to log
in with my ID,

6378e511-c58e-4576-a58d-a38007de2b31-1
00:53:01.687 --> 00:53:09.925
we we say to my ID let the user only
successfully log in if they have a

6378e511-c58e-4576-a58d-a38007de2b31-2
00:53:09.925 --> 00:53:14.960
specific strength in their identity,
right.

0d525634-e1b5-46d9-a65d-5b71e1d8d5a3-0
00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.920
So which is the standard strength?

5c1a4188-3fe0-4bc0-99c6-0f52354eca88-0
00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:19.440
Standard strength is 100 point ID checked.

0f515a88-c467-4779-a616-aa10a87a394a-0
00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.847
OK,
if if they don't have standard strength,

0f515a88-c467-4779-a616-aa10a87a394a-1
00:53:23.847 --> 00:53:26.640
then we go into that error flow.

1d48f648-5537-4e70-9e18-0dff9544df1d-0
00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:27.720
OK, yeah.

072ab7d7-e12b-40d8-bf38-8c7ad234e258-0
00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.040
So then they'll return error.

d65787f4-6cf8-4293-ab52-6168e66524f6-0
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:35.120
So what that means is they have sort of
ignored our advice here.

fe556029-ec3c-4a94-b589-a414bda2cd7f-0
00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:41.120
Even though they don't have standard,
they've continued so in the.

49f166ac-743b-421c-8f1a-6dbc53b68864-0
00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.160
So we need to get them to redirect to
error.

ad9ce37d-b439-4d9e-bb0c-6e20f74d4a94-0
00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.798
Yeah,
error page and then advise them that you

ad9ce37d-b439-4d9e-bb0c-6e20f74d4a94-1
00:53:47.798 --> 00:53:49.160
don't have standard.

9e3f7514-1d45-4c7f-858c-efa886a9375f-0
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:56.280
Either you upgrade your digital ID and
try again or use our secondary service.

cf96b6d0-7027-4224-bc92-384fd31bed2e-0
00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:01.243
OK,
so this error simulation you can't do

cf96b6d0-7027-4224-bc92-384fd31bed2e-1
00:54:01.243 --> 00:54:04.600
because Google doesn't have ID strength.

6ef44b8b-b34f-46c2-9773-d70a8bc1563c-0
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.600
So I couldn't find a way to sort of
simulate this.

9e6339b1-4081-4abe-b36b-31e1e52529fa-0
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.120
This the error part.

c55ad676-becf-42bd-a72d-8368d4868186-0
00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.160
We only can simulate using.

84279032-20eb-4bca-afa7-ca85114f5001-0
00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:19.280
I mean we only can do the programme
implementation using my my, my ID.

aae47073-7703-4c1e-ab9b-306abb6bf38c-0
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:24.434
So the error pages displays an
information asking the user to go to my

aae47073-7703-4c1e-ab9b-306abb6bf38c-1
00:54:24.434 --> 00:54:28.440
ID and then probably provide the
information for the ID check.

0d6e0acd-b6e2-4a6f-b329-66bc3f14bc73-0
00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:32.003
Otherwise we have to go with the
secondary flow which is not yet defined,

0d6e0acd-b6e2-4a6f-b329-66bc3f14bc73-1
00:54:32.003 --> 00:54:32.240
right?

0a1d9c9e-0ca3-4d38-8ab2-23fe469d6011-0
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.960
Yes, that's correct.

d4daa527-b2d7-4de0-a6dd-1932900daec5-0
00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.480
So that error page, it's not AB to C page,
right?

5c46e406-6f17-48d4-9d4d-4ac735cf24c4-0
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.880
So it's a portal page.

54c32191-9526-4168-8c63-73a46fe24a05-0
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:46.587
So we can tell my ID that when we
redirect to my ID, if it fails,

54c32191-9526-4168-8c63-73a46fe24a05-1
00:54:46.587 --> 00:54:51.625
return to portal page and from a portal
page,

54c32191-9526-4168-8c63-73a46fe24a05-2
00:54:51.625 --> 00:54:57.320
then it get so we should have an some
content here.

ee473c36-8305-47c6-801e-2d3a7c28b809-0
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:02.920
Yeah,
to go either actually this should be

ee473c36-8305-47c6-801e-2d3a7c28b809-1
00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:07.480
either here or come back again, right?

b09b524b-fa38-4e1b-96af-5d2a0b6adc70-0
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.400
Come back again to this this flow.

2da834bf-c5e5-4688-a1a2-6f5e9d4032aa-0
00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:17.388
OK,
Because if if there so there's all two

2da834bf-c5e5-4688-a1a2-6f5e9d4032aa-1
00:55:17.388 --> 00:55:19.800
options they have, right?

0c2660eb-cc71-413b-b74d-57b798167af4-0
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:25.634
So, so they,
they say they can say I for some reason I

0c2660eb-cc71-413b-b74d-57b798167af4-1
00:55:25.634 --> 00:55:31.045
can't have my,
I can't strengthen my digital ID to

0c2660eb-cc71-413b-b74d-57b798167af4-2
00:55:31.045 --> 00:55:32.000
standard.

851e610c-5747-45e7-a089-2131ab956ad3-0
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.520
So then I should follow a secondary
process.

f6911fa9-08ef-4e4a-b1bd-2ef66cd1b3c8-0
00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:39.720
So maybe I, I can't,
they have to call support, right?

5c28ef31-c201-4773-9365-01165b721abe-0
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.543
But if they can,
they can go login back to their digital

5c28ef31-c201-4773-9365-01165b721abe-1
00:55:45.543 --> 00:55:49.107
ID and add additional information and
strengthen,

5c28ef31-c201-4773-9365-01165b721abe-2
00:55:49.107 --> 00:55:54.240
and they should be able to come back and
go through this process again.

9d2d928d-b5aa-4658-97d9-b01c16a97c4e-0
00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.120
Right.

3b9ea656-a6f9-4bd8-bb55-59d1bcfd1cdb-0
00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.840
So the error page design has been done by
Abby.

3c3243a0-5470-4b93-9dbf-e6cd8ecb4238-0
00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.640
Is it how how it is?

3013c578-5778-47e6-81e7-ba200214b10a-0
00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:04.000
No, no, no, it hasn't done by Abby.

7dddd45e-cc75-4b0a-b6f6-5c64fd8053c8-0
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.600
But yeah,
so I don't think any of this stuff has.

78e771ff-b5df-4a09-9ec1-ffbaf5e6c61b-0
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.440
She's done it right.

0ef07233-9875-488e-a9e8-0e59f9c91b90-0
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.080
So OK.

7759116d-7d2d-4c29-9b76-f5b5d9942db3-0
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:12.720
Like future work.

43c8224d-96d8-478a-973d-dc218c7e3641-0
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:12.920
Yeah.

37f6a5b3-2c2d-4a7e-aa6e-eb7ae84c77de-0
00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:18.360
But that's how the IT should function.

4520aba6-bbb8-4886-a404-8b5519facd05-0
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.680
Yeah, yeah.

f1d2be87-e841-4634-b953-5f717b59312a-0
00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:32.520
So what I was going to do is,
is multiple IDs for this year.

f6a11040-5c73-4269-be14-2ecb7454c979-0
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:38.440
I'm just going to maybe there's one
minute left.

efb1fa04-f9b5-46a5-8d20-96cac15289c6-0
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:47.760
We'll continue the this hundred point ID
check stuff in the next session.

8ab3e2a4-b13a-4ad9-9516-8fefda5c966b-0
00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.800
Yeah, sure, sure.

9aa56d9b-54a3-4de0-abb5-5bb3f5a36497-0
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:55.626
So I think when 100 point ID stuff is
done,

9aa56d9b-54a3-4de0-abb5-5bb3f5a36497-1
00:56:55.626 --> 00:57:01.040
I don't think there's any more B to C
stuff to hand over.

c12caed2-815f-4608-993c-27eb87cc6cf2-0
00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.861
So maybe,
maybe not another session of B to CS

c12caed2-815f-4608-993c-27eb87cc6cf2-1
00:57:07.861 --> 00:57:09.000
handover left.

775a2b5d-3a61-40ab-be97-56313caaacb1-0
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:20.560
And then I've already did invites for
power copy and Qi import.

a60df18c-8546-4b9d-a7cb-fce6d48d7d9c-0
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.000
Yeah, copy is, is straightforward.

6effece2-6e65-4479-ae13-9da6bc9d5ad3-0
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.532
It's not that difficult,
but we'll see whether Qi import needs a

6effece2-6e65-4479-ae13-9da6bc9d5ad3-1
00:57:31.532 --> 00:57:33.320
little bit more time.

4327a3b6-39fa-4835-a5bd-15e214e64779-0
00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.240
OK, that's pretty much it.

a44ab5b4-d543-4666-a77a-c414ee452317-0
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.600
I think we'll stop now for today.
