Hi Jamie,

Please see the attached Excel sheet with the delivery roadmap I created based on our discussions.

Can you please review and let me know:

* If I missed anything important, and
* If my understanding is correct for each workstream/epic.

Going forward, I suggest we track delivery using this roadmap as the single reference.

Note: This roadmap is currently **high level**. When we start unpacking it, it will break into multiple smaller items (stories/tasks) for requirements and delivery. At that time, we can also correct and align the **ASQA naming conventions** so leadership tracking is clean and consistent.

If there is any other workstream, dependency, or priority order you want me to add, please tell me and I’ll update the sheet.

Thanks,
Prabakaran



Hi Jamie,

Please see the attached Excel roadmap I prepared based on our KT/transcript discussion and the current state across Dev/Test/DevInt/PreProd/Prod.

Can you please review and confirm:

* My understanding is correct (workstreams, scope, and outcomes)
* Priorities + key dependencies are in the right order
* If I missed any major item (especially around gateway/WAF/DNS, B2C invite-only enforcement, document/records pipeline, Palmy↔TGA publishing, and finance/BC)

Going forward, I suggest we use this roadmap as the single tracking reference for delivery.

Note: This is intentionally **high level** right now. When we unpack it, it will break into multiple smaller items (requirements, stories, and acceptance criteria). At that stage we can also align the **ASQA naming conventions** so leadership reporting is clean and consistent.

If you want any changes (owner mapping, target months, or additional workstreams), please let me know and I’ll update the sheet.

Thanks,
Prabakaran
