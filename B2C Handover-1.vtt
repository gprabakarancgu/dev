9a185965-9b47-4eb6-93ab-56306b6e126e-0
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.440
With I will design right?

bc01d143-a430-48bd-a77d-46ce7d4fcff0-0
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.240
I think you guys already know this part.

48544cc6-f590-41e1-a2c7-fd669ef5e54f-0
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.800
So this where the contacts get imported
into database using that effect.

3753f93c-4091-4a2b-ad40-85198da10d75-0
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.760
So what happens is then a email gets sent
out.

07d1c6ae-b5b9-4f41-9c3a-ece2ceb7474a-0
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.120
So in that email you would have ARN to
identify the contact right?

aee6abe1-42b0-445b-9906-ff54f9bb8a77-0
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.058
So once the email gets sent out,
the impacted individual can the email

aee6abe1-42b0-445b-9906-ff54f9bb8a77-1
00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:40.960
will have a link to the dashboard.

9616a581-a4ec-4771-8401-d50594e6d98c-0
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:51.389
So what happens is the user landed on the
portal and get redirected to B to C So B

9616a581-a4ec-4771-8401-d50594e6d98c-1
00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:56.040
should to C have this concept of policies.

13a06d28-76a4-4c2a-b057-a29e680054b1-0
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.169
So you can have many,
as many as you want and you can from

13a06d28-76a4-4c2a-b057-a29e680054b1-1
00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:08.160
portal you can get them to redirect to us.

5202c6f0-1f14-4b85-baa1-b27153ca67c1-0
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.920
So each policy in in in B to C sort of
have a URL.

84e919ed-90b1-4fc7-b614-868566b6e186-0
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.509
So,
so you can get a user redirected to AB to

84e919ed-90b1-4fc7-b614-868566b6e186-1
00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.440
C policy, right.

fe0926a8-3607-441c-9cd2-5f05817f1639-0
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.560
So this is what we're talking about the
other day.

c091e3ba-9b10-4db4-9297-4d2bb41014a0-0
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.014
So maybe we can leave the impacted
individual policy as it is and then we

c091e3ba-9b10-4db4-9297-4d2bb41014a0-1
00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:35.760
can develop a new policy for arms.

5e8f1188-bd20-4684-9380-f3b4997a4ade-0
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.299
If there's a interim state,
if we go into the end state fully,

5e8f1188-bd20-4684-9380-f3b4997a4ade-1
00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.703
we would just have one policy which is
the as per sign in sign up policy will

5e8f1188-bd20-4684-9380-f3b4997a4ade-2
00:01:49.703 --> 00:01:53.880
handle impacted individuals as well as
RTO.

38e1baf8-c921-47c3-8bc4-f1d09c4f0679-0
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.640
All the personas will be handled right.

7753f1e2-9505-44b5-8096-5a2f4aa46774-0
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.080
So to the portal have a configuration.

fcb48107-9a46-430d-8066-5d4a8a205384-0
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.320
So portal can have different identity
providers, B to C is one of them.

dedc48d5-14da-4e3c-a5fe-bf508b2c3f48-0
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.960
So in portal you can configure more than
one.

3783ab78-1b5b-44b5-9e07-6eab3f4aceff-0
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.484
So one probably the other policies that
we may require in the future is for

3783ab78-1b5b-44b5-9e07-6eab3f4aceff-1
00:02:28.484 --> 00:02:33.716
example,
so currently we don't we have sign in,

3783ab78-1b5b-44b5-9e07-6eab3f4aceff-2
00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:38.730
sign up,
but we don't have like email address

3783ab78-1b5b-44b5-9e07-6eab3f4aceff-3
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.000
change or phone number change.

e0371df3-1942-458c-ac8f-d4db18927485-0
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.213
So that can be done using a separate
policy and and also another example of

e0371df3-1942-458c-ac8f-d4db18927485-1
00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:53.040
having another separate policies,
100 point ID check, right.

bfce0a8a-7775-4a9e-bc0e-c71f0f836c69-0
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.720
So the 100 point ID check could be its
own policy.

2a3db97f-7d30-4ea0-a0b4-9a211198b400-0
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:13.197
So you could in, in, in, in power portal,
like if you go to the power portal here

2a3db97f-7d30-4ea0-a0b4-9a211198b400-1
00:03:13.197 --> 00:03:24.720
as part part of the identity providers,
you can have policies.

af98e241-3114-453a-b5c6-4f70c2982a22-0
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:57.130
The security tab identity providers can
be to see identity providers.

cf314283-e547-449e-9afa-6c0326f83190-0
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.170
So you can see is the policy I was
referring to.

72276b01-ce47-4af0-b129-07d4c88f5bd4-0
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.170
So we already have two policies,
which is the sign in sign up.

c24ba586-a372-48ed-be71-52bd1ff16952-0
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.450
Is it?

193b4c56-7653-4bdf-9f39-e19822d6f210-0
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.080
It's one policy and the password reset is
another another policy.

0a460fdc-e71e-42c9-823f-8c3f700ba68a-0
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:18.499
So if you go back to Azure B to C,
like when you get access to the Azure B

0a460fdc-e71e-42c9-823f-8c3f700ba68a-1
00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:25.761
to C tenants, for example,
if you click on this settings button,

0a460fdc-e71e-42c9-823f-8c3f700ba68a-2
00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:32.800
so it will show you all the B to C
tenants you have access to.

b60665a5-5b91-41fc-8cc7-3aa06a3215d5-0
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.560
So I'll switch back to.

755d7cc3-59b9-486c-93e6-6473158603e7-0
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.880
So these were all the Azure resources are
right.

7ad673fe-66f5-4c5e-8b65-c81da21f2552-0
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.765
So the logic apps and keyboards and all
our other Azure resources are here and

7ad673fe-66f5-4c5e-8b65-c81da21f2552-1
00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:48.760
the B to C resources are here.

70dfe6c3-e75f-46ff-ae6d-7f48ffa7f6b6-0
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.240
So we've got a few environments.

bfb0a785-c227-4183-a6ab-e9f86c63f707-0
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.960
We've got dev, test,
pre prod and production.

0782093b-36ad-4121-b833-2088b0a7bf57-0
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.120
Soon we're gonna have Devin.

83d10218-7c30-4820-b059-1e0ffd4abbc7-0
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.760
Devin will be sharing in dev environment.

ce337860-1ed8-4dfa-905f-5d3056e738c7-0
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:31.760
So if I go switch back to so you can go
to HDB to see.

58b66c71-5467-45df-9e2a-51c6208391f7-0
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:40.166
So as I mentioned before,
so all the sign in sign up is custom for

58b66c71-5467-45df-9e2a-51c6208391f7-1
00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:40.480
us.

83b45492-f9d8-497d-9bd5-9a41255b052c-0
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.880
We don't use any of the user flows.

beb831dc-e655-42c4-ac27-653fcc7dd780-0
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.800
So everything is in here.

70d37ced-b123-4180-951a-205f50ef6a19-0
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.800
So you can see those two policies that we
had in here.

74f46ebb-9f49-4807-a410-dcbbeda000ae-0
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.241
I,
I is the impacted individual sign in sign

74f46ebb-9f49-4807-a410-dcbbeda000ae-1
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:02.640
up and impacted individual password reset.

b1353281-7c39-482d-ae4c-af7550efe068-0
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.775
So going back to the policies,
so you have those two policies here,

b1353281-7c39-482d-ae4c-af7550efe068-1
00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:11.200
right?

52b75a26-99f6-494d-8d31-756bdeb00251-0
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.180
So for example,
so so you can see there are some other

52b75a26-99f6-494d-8d31-756bdeb00251-1
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.880
policies as well.

4164f5ea-686d-4bf8-9fa0-cc4eac0d4647-0
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:30.920
So you can think of policies as if in
sort of object oriented programming.

40e37c77-0b95-40b3-a218-c6c2379a493e-0
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.520
It has inheritance.

388adaa4-7075-447c-9bd0-3b35f2a928f1-0
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:44.312
So you can have a base and base can have
functions and then so you can have like

388adaa4-7075-447c-9bd0-3b35f2a928f1-1
00:06:44.312 --> 00:06:51.536
your most common functions in base and
then your extensions,

388adaa4-7075-447c-9bd0-3b35f2a928f1-2
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:55.800
you can extend those base functions.

72745626-f0b1-40e0-92c0-b570df805441-0
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.040
So you can have more more targeted
functions in the next layer.

3c2237ad-7764-4711-a1e4-9bfe374899e8-0
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.320
And then as yes, as you go on, right.

869112e0-c77b-41c6-ab18-de136db86352-0
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.846
So,
so the way I've structured is you have

869112e0-c77b-41c6-ab18-de136db86352-1
00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:16.160
the base as couple set of function
policies and and then there's a extension

869112e0-c77b-41c6-ab18-de136db86352-2
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.440
to it and then the II sits on top of it.

7e59068b-aa91-44a9-9ef5-9f87ae594770-0
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:28.106
So maybe in another session I'll go on
and describe how I'm planning to put the

7e59068b-aa91-44a9-9ef5-9f87ae594770-1
00:07:28.106 --> 00:07:29.600
RTO stuff in it.

f63544d2-4217-4fe0-86b6-2d4e5e6cab39-0
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.280
So this is just what we got in production,
right?

d36cf764-655b-44bd-8e11-5d923dc4571f-0
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.042
If you browse to it,
this is what I was referring to before,

d36cf764-655b-44bd-8e11-5d923dc4571f-1
00:07:38.042 --> 00:07:38.440
right.

6b15e2b4-7a27-4a9e-9da2-3ef471e030aa-0
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:48.480
So each policy sort of have a own its own
URL.

34bbc9b9-4d55-489c-919c-3055e684e290-0
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:56.040
So you can you can redirect from anywhere
to B to C So you can see.

d3cac0fc-b3c0-4f7a-9f93-241da8db44af-0
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.840
So this is blocked, right?

1dbd5b74-0249-4a36-89d2-2ea5ec3bb885-0
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.080
So the the reason being this is block is
so this is the B to CURL.

95121bfc-fe57-41fb-8bd2-d995644f4e2b-0
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:16.856
So we also have Azure front end in front
of Azure B to C So when I use when a user

95121bfc-fe57-41fb-8bd2-d995644f4e2b-1
00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:24.165
get redirected to B to C it won't get
redirected B to C straight away it will

95121bfc-fe57-41fb-8bd2-d995644f4e2b-2
00:08:24.165 --> 00:08:26.320
come through front end.

6d285207-afce-41bb-9566-9a6fa119e12a-0
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.382
So the the the the benefit of coming
through front end is front end provides

6d285207-afce-41bb-9566-9a6fa119e12a-1
00:08:33.382 --> 00:08:38.120
additional features like web application
firewalls, right?

14fb3712-19d2-48c1-9718-582b0ac6ae09-0
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:48.524
So if you getting malicious uses when the
requests are redirected through web

14fb3712-19d2-48c1-9718-582b0ac6ae09-1
00:08:48.524 --> 00:08:59.330
access firewalls so it can detect so so
the the the the URL of our front door is

14fb3712-19d2-48c1-9718-582b0ac6ae09-2
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:06.000
the environment dot auth dot S square dot
dot AU.

a79e3d3b-e5d4-4158-b860-6e3f96052f69-0
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.120
So production is without the environment.

40bdc35f-b844-430b-a5b1-398414fa0460-0
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:20.409
So any environment I think we browsing to
test right not there that's the reset

40bdc35f-b844-430b-a5b1-398414fa0460-1
00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:21.680
password.

bd9702f8-eaf4-40bb-9f04-76c5379c99f4-0
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.400
So that should get rendered.

9e6d73c2-0191-436d-8461-15a102e095da-0
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:35.854
The other thing maybe worth mentioning is
so the production version is not styled

9e6d73c2-0191-436d-8461-15a102e095da-1
00:09:35.854 --> 00:09:37.080
as as this.

57b8fa56-02f7-48be-8090-a172bdd97f0b-0
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.560
It has like very basic styling.

2d75096f-dd41-46f3-a9b9-cfb55992ba73-0
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.000
So.

794b77e2-e96f-4f21-b2b9-8d36d224a18e-0
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:51.160
So if you look at,
maybe I'll go to sign up, sign up, set up.

46445997-8b14-4ef3-abc5-193f4cd9bda0-0
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:51.440
Browser caching open window two days to
restart my browser.

ec320e30-ce60-4cd5-978b-082d79e8062b-0
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:32.680
Yeah.

e319f213-984a-47c9-aedb-c02029d534c4-0
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:53.494
So if I look at the the developer tool
and if I look at the the network traffic

e319f213-984a-47c9-aedb-c02029d534c4-1
00:11:53.494 --> 00:12:06.754
going out,
so you can see when the B to C is loaded,

e319f213-984a-47c9-aedb-c02029d534c4-2
00:12:06.754 --> 00:12:22.266
it calls that Powerball lab,
which is which is this one here,

e319f213-984a-47c9-aedb-c02029d534c4-3
00:12:22.266 --> 00:12:27.520
the test environment.

306536eb-c521-4c23-9ff6-79785fe4496f-0
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.480
So it's hosted in test environment.

92b6a370-3d9e-4b65-9398-78b3ad68f7a8-0
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.600
It's only hosted in test environment.

953fff32-374f-469e-83fd-466d5d3a106f-0
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:39.044
So,
so B to C have the model of the old HTML

953fff32-374f-469e-83fd-466d5d3a106f-1
00:12:39.044 --> 00:12:43.400
is generated from by the BTC itself.

38ff4148-8b46-428b-a112-f63b9c661881-0
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.640
We can't really do much about it.

0aeb681d-3268-439d-97cb-d85136f20100-0
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.866
The the whatever the policy that we've
got configured get converted into HTML

0aeb681d-3268-439d-97cb-d85136f20100-1
00:12:52.866 --> 00:12:58.680
and that gets speeded out as with default
CSS and default HTML, right?

e8f478bd-7a98-4355-ad8f-84f0814b2eec-0
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.160
So that's very, you know,
basic styling that we got.

f413ac74-124b-41f9-8bb1-45edbf26ff96-0
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:11.014
So if you want to do more styling,
if you want to make it more prettier,

f413ac74-124b-41f9-8bb1-45edbf26ff96-1
00:13:11.014 --> 00:13:15.240
then B to C provides the sort of like
extension.

64b351ed-4760-4aa9-b9e5-3ed5c508a4ce-0
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:26.583
So what you can put is you can put,
you can get B to C to render HTML and

64b351ed-4760-4aa9-b9e5-3ed5c508a4ce-1
00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:36.640
then you can load a the template HTML
template from somewhere else.

c6cf677c-5040-4520-99fd-c6b8caae3ae5-0
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:46.841
So for for our instance,
so we decided to store that HTML template

c6cf677c-5040-4520-99fd-c6b8caae3ae5-1
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:51.160
in power in a power portal site.

1e9e342e-2c5e-4ce1-9fb6-ddcef64e476f-0
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.844
So we decided to just to have single
power portal site for the non product

1e9e342e-2c5e-4ce1-9fb6-ddcef64e476f-1
00:13:59.844 --> 00:14:00.760
environments.

945ad13c-a797-4c59-8297-9dbf9a92c2d8-0
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:14.569
So you can see if you go to the power
portal and you have is different HTML

945ad13c-a797-4c59-8297-9dbf9a92c2d8-1
00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:19.720
templates in each one of them.

9c3ce929-960d-4901-a644-6f09e7e8c197-0
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:27.829
So, so going back to our test,
so for this page,

9c3ce929-960d-4901-a644-6f09e7e8c197-1
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:35.240
it was loading the HTML from this part
here.

f4a05dc3-4a7f-4bad-846f-fb24f3748823-0
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.000
So there's self asserted.

c3938447-8b42-4fb4-b515-5568edd5fef2-0
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:44.431
I think we should be able to see the
response unless the yeah,

c3938447-8b42-4fb4-b515-5568edd5fef2-1
00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:46.120
it's the response.

7decdb9a-e5ef-4bc1-a738-b529354730ce-0
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.600
This is the HTML return.

748b77bc-276c-4949-9e92-50ec73291da8-0
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.320
So that's all coming.

bbf25b22-7356-43fa-b79f-750d8d6ee5ec-0
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.280
That's all.

5fcc2f8d-d717-4f97-b56a-3ec300d91221-0
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:52.960
Sorry.

06747a8d-baa5-4d1d-97c2-a4dd0aa2e4c4-0
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:59.520
It's hosted in in in power bottle,
but it's it's it's static.

ffd9eb86-c1b2-400e-999f-2121144513a8-0
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:08.000
So what it does is so this this HTML
template have all the CSS and custom CSS

ffd9eb86-c1b2-400e-999f-2121144513a8-1
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.080
and whatever images or whatever in there.

cdb1cbe6-9a94-493c-8fdb-c8c91143f8ec-0
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:24.580
And then what B to C does is B to C
renders all this HTML onto A sort of like

cdb1cbe6-9a94-493c-8fdb-c8c91143f8ec-1
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.480
a placeholder.

c413f59e-ddef-45ff-b962-9b62f39d9793-0
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.520
So there's this thing called this,
this is the placeholder.

83ebaf3a-57bc-431f-9d35-11962db72f27-0
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.560
So all this.

1c3e79ca-36f1-4ac7-898a-0414b76ab903-0
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:43.600
So if you look at the,
you look at the HTML content, right?

812488d5-e754-4053-b9a7-c492263f70df-0
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.120
So this is all from the template.

95fc88d1-6ade-4716-ba45-747d0b85983d-0
00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:06.067
All this above here is from the template
that we read from the power portal and

95fc88d1-6ade-4716-ba45-747d0b85983d-1
00:16:06.067 --> 00:16:12.000
and this is to that the placeholder,
right?

8e096808-ce8d-4dbc-ad42-416baa544e18-0
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.257
So, so B to C,
what BC does is B to C put all the HTML

8e096808-ce8d-4dbc-ad42-416baa544e18-1
00:16:17.257 --> 00:16:19.360
into this placeholder.

03330f34-89b2-4061-a3f4-ee8167f8c683-0
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:34.360
So we've got so we have we have as per
scripts.

13089044-d8b4-4d1e-a29a-5f0a2bad3944-0
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.745
So, so we can,
what we can do is so we're doing some

13089044-d8b4-4d1e-a29a-5f0a2bad3944-1
00:16:39.745 --> 00:16:40.840
modifications.

f3b8d890-da64-4744-a3e3-9643c750231b-0
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.440
I think it's very similar to the way that
sort of power portal works, right?

de49d07a-d4ac-4498-a98d-5acfdf5f901a-0
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.720
So you through JavaScript,
you can change the HTML.

01be34e7-2e80-4a5a-bcef-eaf028018587-0
00:16:53.520 --> 00:17:00.611
So I'm, I'm doing some modifications,
basic modifications through JavaScript to

01be34e7-2e80-4a5a-bcef-eaf028018587-1
00:17:00.611 --> 00:17:07.525
change some of these HTML elements,
which I can't really do that using policy

01be34e7-2e80-4a5a-bcef-eaf028018587-2
00:17:07.525 --> 00:17:07.880
XML.

f2c6b20b-c1de-4647-8536-af9be984a148-0
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.640
So it's it's it's done through the
JavaScript and CSS.

b6975f44-76e5-4caa-a86b-59ff4d205e4c-0
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:19.240
So that's the custom JavaScript we've got
and then we got custom CSS.

f7b7157c-19cd-4b87-9edd-87171b146eba-0
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.283
So this,
this test environment doesn't have the

f7b7157c-19cd-4b87-9edd-87171b146eba-1
00:17:25.283 --> 00:17:27.280
RMA stuff deployed.

d9424fa7-62e5-40df-a3d6-ff4db05aa1a8-0
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:35.229
But so I, I've,
I've changed starting to align with more,

d9424fa7-62e5-40df-a3d6-ff4db05aa1a8-1
00:17:35.229 --> 00:17:38.080
more, more portal like.

5595b3c5-dc0e-4468-b687-687bb1a0de77-0
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.520
So that styling is already done for you
guys.

db77a4f8-f126-4f07-bfc2-13e0ca3a8356-0
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.720
You can use that.

4b6b9bf5-8d36-47be-84f5-3b816f8ad715-0
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.280
That's in a separate branch.

36a75377-b0ea-4d48-9d28-d491cd774038-0
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.760
So I'll get to the source port little bit
later.

37fa2620-91f2-47c5-b929-9046cf161a17-0
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:55.640
So going back to the hey Dinaka, sorry,
just yeah, one thing.

21608842-6a82-48ed-b581-875d3343f35a-0
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.846
So when you're showing that HTML controls,
right,

21608842-6a82-48ed-b581-875d3343f35a-1
00:17:58.846 --> 00:18:03.400
how do you map like which control is
mapped with which B to C control?

709ee697-60d9-4003-9856-baed6c0682fe-0
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.320
How do you map that?

0186087e-a541-4565-a3c7-23a60594edb4-0
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.709
Is it done in the Azure portal or are you
handling that as part of the JavaScript

0186087e-a541-4565-a3c7-23a60594edb4-1
00:18:09.709 --> 00:18:11.240
code that you showed us?

f1b00c51-112f-4033-94ca-5e6e4e858d56-0
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.680
So when you say mapping,
what do you so you have this email

f1b00c51-112f-4033-94ca-5e6e4e858d56-1
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.100
address control,
you have the password control there,

f1b00c51-112f-4033-94ca-5e6e4e858d56-2
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:20.480
right?

025e8354-7235-49f8-b0a8-52c75cd7fb62-0
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.160
Yep, Yep.

e7361214-f648-4b67-9ed0-e9a751dd31fd-0
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.080
So how this is this is like a CSS on the
portal side, right?

2486973e-3ad5-42c6-aad9-bd69c9fb61a7-0
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.599
CSS and HTML controls that you are
capturing or this page itself is B to C

2486973e-3ad5-42c6-aad9-bd69c9fb61a7-1
00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:34.440
and you're customising it through power
portal.

34765422-4738-4050-ac0a-d697592986c0-0
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.640
Yeah, so page is B to C, so they HT.

02d4de31-c172-46ca-b188-0e41d73bca73-0
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:46.280
So let me show you so,
so this is a policy.

2fc05f29-1ab1-41f4-917e-5214ff91ffbf-0
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.372
So, so,
so I showed you a few policies there,

2fc05f29-1ab1-41f4-917e-5214ff91ffbf-1
00:18:49.372 --> 00:18:49.760
right?

83ca233c-100e-49c7-be82-d52423a3e630-0
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.320
Yeah, yeah.

719e46a6-1772-4e51-9cd3-996f7e8bbbac-0
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:57.191
For example, said sign in,
sign up is this policy and the policy

719e46a6-1772-4e51-9cd3-996f7e8bbbac-1
00:18:57.191 --> 00:18:59.360
policies here, right.

2dadf8d5-6ee4-4cd7-89f9-67fdd9ad40d2-0
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:05.680
So there's there's a thing called no,
not that maybe this one here.

135e42a8-670c-4128-a6e9-56330acc3ee4-0
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.800
So you can see there are fields, right?

dbe3da8d-4eb6-4f13-8ad3-50150b582fa1-0
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.160
So there's ARN field, Yeah.

65bdd85c-72c0-481a-a437-86488e1bc23d-0
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:17.000
And it says that ARN field is a text box
and it's Spring, right.

3e88d3eb-5773-4a00-80bd-378c90ad76da-0
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:23.880
So when we define these fields like this
in XML, yeah,

3e88d3eb-5773-4a00-80bd-378c90ad76da-1
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.480
B to C generates the HTML for it.

9c771b9e-c5a9-4b35-9251-97c633e92152-0
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.640
OK, right.

1cbc43b3-8655-40b2-a2fe-312abbbc8dbf-0
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:30.360
Yeah.

1f11dabf-d5ff-48aa-981d-569f6a69bf97-0
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.276
And then if you want to do any
customization to that, so, so I mean,

1f11dabf-d5ff-48aa-981d-569f6a69bf97-1
00:19:34.276 --> 00:19:37.760
the information that you can provide here
is very basic, right?

f41e20c4-06ca-4500-9a94-132a213eb5a1-0
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.567
It's just,
you can tell it's a text box and a string,

f41e20c4-06ca-4500-9a94-132a213eb5a1-1
00:19:41.567 --> 00:19:46.800
but you can't tell what's the width of
the textbooks that you want, right?

fca35d19-7abc-4f96-a861-4ee4e69d227e-0
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.057
Or,
or or or you want to placeholder in the

fca35d19-7abc-4f96-a861-4ee4e69d227e-1
00:19:50.057 --> 00:19:50.560
textbook.

c11b3a24-fce3-4e3e-8e70-012a932aa8a2-0
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.960
So I don't know you want the textbooks
disabled, right?

4dcb81d4-28dd-4a72-95af-d6a8fdc8a7b6-0
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.000
So you can't really tell that from here.

cead58ef-f061-421b-ae35-2590aa149d74-0
00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:08.760
But that's the bit that comes from the
CSN SSN, the JavaScript, for example.

bed9dd8a-49da-418d-a3b9-89474974a18e-0
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.400
So this is.

94bd00fc-b0a8-4b40-91e6-a3a82264363a-0
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.600
Yeah, this is this have more CSS.

fb0b0d4f-7bdc-48d0-a9fd-d64884240d68-0
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.320
This is the styling.

50e95d2d-891e-4467-9e97-2838c14f6e25-0
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:22.848
I put all the correct fonts and
everything in there and you know,

50e95d2d-891e-4467-9e97-2838c14f6e25-1
00:20:22.848 --> 00:20:28.212
font sizes,
all the styling is coming from here and

50e95d2d-891e-4467-9e97-2838c14f6e25-2
00:20:28.212 --> 00:20:36.362
anything that I wanted to sort of do that
I can't get done through the policy,

50e95d2d-891e-4467-9e97-2838c14f6e25-3
00:20:36.362 --> 00:20:39.560
I do it through the JavaScript.

a7ef7380-28b4-41dc-8fa3-f22745180899-0
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.400
So that page you are just reading and
then customising it using Power Portal.

37fbecdc-28c6-471f-8b61-5481b488a423-0
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.400
That B to C page.

d9004337-dc14-41a3-8b9e-cf07aa03657c-0
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.240
Yeah, it's not from Power Portal, right?

9358bf6a-2a02-416f-b06c-ddbfd0cbf21f-0
00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.980
So, OK, so,
so So what happens is this is the HTML

9358bf6a-2a02-416f-b06c-ddbfd0cbf21f-1
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.640
template.

ca194e10-c132-4f77-b29a-a236635c9fda-0
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.640
This HTML template is hosted in Power
Portal, right?

eaadc8ee-949e-497f-b00f-755f6e55e865-0
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.280
But this is still B to part of the B to C
solution.

78616eb4-3673-453b-8fae-e4fa0ec8e92c-0
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.240
So I'll,
I'll explain how this get deployed.

c0371aa6-808c-422f-9d78-c5ad941a14ab-0
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.480
Right.

daad3930-4dc1-4f2e-a9db-43b32beb2170-0
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.320
So,
so all the all the source code in here.

5a3e0783-5b68-4729-b68b-209ee8282a81-0
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.369
So,
so these are different types of templates

5a3e0783-5b68-4729-b68b-209ee8282a81-1
00:21:14.369 --> 00:21:15.800
for different pages.

dbc02571-b4ad-4d34-a2f5-d06aa0d60d9f-0
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.694
OK,
so this is all the code is in the git

dbc02571-b4ad-4d34-a2f5-d06aa0d60d9f-1
00:21:20.694 --> 00:21:21.840
repository.

f17ee6c6-1bfb-460d-90ea-6f1b98becb26-0
00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:22.400
Yeah.

92ab139b-a08c-453c-8bd3-e27caf5dd7d0-0
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:31.560
But when it get deployed it deploys this
HTML as web template.

84c49589-b69f-4b4c-9c45-5a65e959fdcc-0
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.200
So.

bde643fb-f954-4078-b7d3-ff097e8d64a4-0
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:39.800
So if I go to the power portal again.

17ab955f-be1a-4192-87fa-5fa7ef531473-0
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.760
So if I go to.

7b865dcf-7171-446b-bbf4-a2f442d3cf84-0
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:20.040
So if I go here, there are web templates,
yeah, So web templates, for example.

053ad528-f103-4463-be4f-885e6f6f840e-0
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.640
So that has the that HTML, right?

78f381e0-91f2-4d4d-bcfe-0fd6b0d9170a-0
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:28.800
Yeah.

e90fe66b-f964-467c-a29b-c78c97c780db-0
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:41.640
So this hosts the HTML, the template,
the the, the, the, the.

bb452ac7-427f-4795-abc2-e8a821bb219a-0
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.320
So there's, there's a lot of CSS in here.

99a9cc72-e8f1-46b2-a2eb-593a4150bd38-0
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.040
So go back to that HTML, right?

cbc83021-a8d9-4a30-bc50-f6ac547cf1de-0
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.600
So I think that's the important bit.

47271653-318c-49fd-8b60-8a767687e959-0
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:58.160
So the template provides the basic HTML.

a07b9dac-5426-4241-af28-fc712457bca6-0
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.440
So, so, yeah, HTML start from here, right?

cf0bd5ec-9308-4498-a3d1-456debcfa17d-0
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.040
So the above is the CSS and JavaScript.

1cf8aa96-d392-4ac8-bccf-8f4460ce3d9e-0
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.640
And then this is the template bit, right?

499c987e-529a-468a-8207-6ff12689c843-0
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:13.696
This is the placeholder bit, Yeah,
so B so So what what B to C does is B to

499c987e-529a-468a-8207-6ff12689c843-1
00:23:13.696 --> 00:23:16.760
C reads this HTML and CSS, right?

2eacd7a7-5f09-4c1a-9b96-12fc71f99dbc-0
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.880
And reads this bit, right?

208e6afb-dd5a-4343-89f7-a298d2a554c9-0
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.400
Yep.

3fa65575-c088-4f7f-adb0-9cf9a0b29486-0
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:30.833
And then converts the XML into HTML and
put that HTML inside here,

3fa65575-c088-4f7f-adb0-9cf9a0b29486-1
00:23:30.833 --> 00:23:34.200
but right inside this dev.

b1dc40b7-4f9a-4c36-98c8-a265ef97d4a6-0
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.200
You mean the particularly inside this dev?

13e2af8f-6418-4813-a887-d46cb70639f3-0
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.800
OK, the the rest remains as it is,
All right.

07f86134-6b67-4c10-b6cc-ffbe199e4705-0
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.737
Yeah,
it just inserts the the generated HTML

07f86134-6b67-4c10-b6cc-ffbe199e4705-1
00:23:45.737 --> 00:23:48.200
into into this dev tag.

70f53a5c-2367-4417-8633-9d9cb89e46bb-0
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.000
OK.

a2b28168-8957-4f43-b1d4-aabc93d356db-0
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:57.044
And then what happened is is in the page
load JavaScript get run as soon as the

a2b28168-8957-4f43-b1d4-aabc93d356db-1
00:23:57.044 --> 00:24:00.440
the HTML is loaded into the Dom, right.

1fc9d1e8-853f-4833-96f8-0c10ced8dc0b-0
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:07.831
And like on page ready, yeah,
we can go and we have access to all the

1fc9d1e8-853f-4833-96f8-0c10ced8dc0b-1
00:24:07.831 --> 00:24:12.678
HTML elements already generated by B to C,
So we can yeah,

1fc9d1e8-853f-4833-96f8-0c10ced8dc0b-2
00:24:12.678 --> 00:24:17.280
do modifications to them if we need any
customizations.

c67185fb-9e3d-438d-b65e-4efcc3681b03-0
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.480
OK, after so just getting sorry,
rather you go ahead.

d1c60807-dfce-4d35-be95-85fc626adcfc-0
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.920
I have one question, Tanika.

b1deb27f-db41-4a9a-8fb4-992fd298b950-0
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:29.151
Like the extension test power pages,
it's mainly used to host the public CSS

b1deb27f-db41-4a9a-8fb4-992fd298b950-1
00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:30.560
or HTML, is it?

c7b23847-bd0d-4ea0-95c6-5086a0acb4fc-0
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:30.720
Yes.

f1cbc9cd-e785-4714-88e4-a889daecf211-0
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.421
So,
so we are creating some HTML our CSS in

f1cbc9cd-e785-4714-88e4-a889daecf211-1
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:42.442
extension power pages site and we are
putting that link in Azure B to C for the

f1cbc9cd-e785-4714-88e4-a889daecf211-2
00:24:42.442 --> 00:24:43.319
reference.

ea78adcd-4bbd-4df9-a523-03c58604375a-0
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:43.880
Yes.

db2dd3cb-7485-4b62-b999-243bd895f616-0
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.994
So that reference the self asserted that
united that multi factor HTML or in B to

db2dd3cb-7485-4b62-b999-243bd895f616-1
00:24:50.994 --> 00:24:55.320
C or it's in power pages site it's in
power pages, right.

bcbca907-00db-4af2-948b-31fce7a16a6e-0
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.490
OK,
so the power pages we have three HTML

bcbca907-00db-4af2-948b-31fce7a16a6e-1
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.920
there.

cd30384d-a35f-4dda-9ddb-ab34507df081-0
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:05.405
Yes and we are referring that page in the
power B to C CSS external URL or

cd30384d-a35f-4dda-9ddb-ab34507df081-1
00:25:05.405 --> 00:25:07.120
something PTC policy.

85cd1e5e-3d3e-4d56-942c-911fec1f4a28-0
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.760
So so PTC policy.

b81f56aa-497b-475a-94b7-ce12c42d37e4-0
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.460
Yeah,
today's so I'll show you where it's been

b81f56aa-497b-475a-94b7-ce12c42d37e4-1
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.360
referred.

eb4d6466-3144-4e14-9575-14afe35a3178-0
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:14.880
Yep.

dda1a811-129b-4f7b-b867-f4f64f86d8ed-0
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:26.785
Since only can be updated in VS Code,
we can't see it in the portal for for

dda1a811-129b-4f7b-b867-f4f64f86d8ed-1
00:25:26.785 --> 00:25:29.520
power Power Azure portal, Yeah.

455bf0b7-0a27-496b-96f2-370f1e176de2-0
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.444
Would you be able to show us where you
put that URL,

455bf0b7-0a27-496b-96f2-370f1e176de2-1
00:25:33.444 --> 00:25:36.480
that extension test site URL, the common.

bcbe4555-bfbc-4eaf-92a5-b4ec8f331299-0
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.800
So that's all code code.

620d91ec-ca69-4746-b46b-52272966ac72-0
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.800
It's only code.

f23c98f1-f578-466d-8eff-df039b5ce26a-0
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:48.006
So this is so if you want to modify
anything you modify here and deploy OK,

f23c98f1-f578-466d-8eff-df039b5ce26a-1
00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:49.600
so so you can see.

b2bd659e-4ee4-4335-8047-81a35093f857-0
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.671
So for example,
so these are the places that it refers to

b2bd659e-4ee4-4335-8047-81a35093f857-1
00:25:56.671 --> 00:25:58.240
that HTML, right?

c5936ac4-c494-41db-840f-09f92a869230-0
00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.059
So, so I, I sort of,
so this is configured,

c5936ac4-c494-41db-840f-09f92a869230-1
00:26:03.059 --> 00:26:07.400
this is implemented to do deploy
automatically.

904dbbe2-64f0-417a-8580-d5bb2c6467ee-0
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.020
So,
So what happens is like you can see

904dbbe2-64f0-417a-8580-d5bb2c6467ee-1
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:17.400
there's a host placeholder and then the
path, right?

7a6ce3b2-979f-4135-af81-d2bb9993c171-0
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.873
The HTML path,
if you go to the sort of like

7a6ce3b2-979f-4135-af81-d2bb9993c171-1
00:26:20.873 --> 00:26:25.659
environments environment,
each environment would have its own

7a6ce3b2-979f-4135-af81-d2bb9993c171-2
00:26:25.659 --> 00:26:26.200
config.

1a90de18-c937-43e2-863e-51986c1324dd-0
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:37.366
You can see the host is that extension
site, extension site Dash, dev Dash,

1a90de18-c937-43e2-863e-51986c1324dd-1
00:26:37.366 --> 00:26:40.400
whatever that is, right?

dc989ecc-1570-4399-9ead-dc25de571d6a-0
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:47.960
So if you're going back to here,
so that this will be Dash unified, right?

35474539-f9fc-42a8-a1ba-67721d6ef7f5-0
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:57.004
So going back to here,
so that will be referring to dev Dash

35474539-f9fc-42a8-a1ba-67721d6ef7f5-1
00:26:57.004 --> 00:27:01.000
unified, this one here, right?

c695a9aa-125b-4ead-b271-6c367df77d70-0
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.360
So that's how it get mapped.

e7a9fd67-dabc-4a65-ab39-4a8783c86419-0
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:12.528
So if you look at the test environment
that's different, Yeah,

e7a9fd67-dabc-4a65-ab39-4a8783c86419-1
00:27:12.528 --> 00:27:15.960
it's prefixed by text test.

1b176999-92f0-42ec-a6f5-190de9475232-0
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:18.840
Yeah.

f3342c7d-702c-461e-a353-b0eb3ae18b82-0
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.640
So that's how you get the one we are
showing it behind the screen like the

f3342c7d-702c-461e-a353-b0eb3ae18b82-1
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.800
power pages side that is the extension
side web template, right?

33369f6f-241a-4ece-8e58-ffadc09ab283-0
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:28.560
Yes.

023b2006-1fda-464f-9bf7-68633944abe4-0
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.960
So this one is not our normal power pages.

f335ab2b-2ff9-419b-b53f-c23779b8aeae-0
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.520
No, this is specific one.

0c3189f1-009b-4a4d-8362-91a48461aca3-0
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.240
OK, Yeah.

3f1d7d4f-53a3-49f4-9f03-4e30b256da85-0
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.646
So in so difference is in production
these pages,

3f1d7d4f-53a3-49f4-9f03-4e30b256da85-1
00:27:37.646 --> 00:27:40.560
these templates are within our site.

f93daee0-7605-46f9-9b82-9ac3b315ba65-0
00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.800
Yeah, I saw that.

9cf81519-ce9c-4eed-88fe-3fb60985f2a1-0
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.833
Yeah,
in production I saw these files are in

9cf81519-ce9c-4eed-88fe-3fb60985f2a1-1
00:27:45.833 --> 00:27:49.451
the I saw the self asset at 1:00 Yeah and
multi factor one,

9cf81519-ce9c-4eed-88fe-3fb60985f2a1-2
00:27:49.451 --> 00:27:54.094
are we referring do we need extension
site then if you are able to put it in

9cf81519-ce9c-4eed-88fe-3fb60985f2a1-3
00:27:54.094 --> 00:27:55.120
the current site.

ec04d60e-8acb-4307-9994-c64c157773c3-0
00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:01.046
So so so the reason to have this as a
extension site is these pages need to be

ec04d60e-8acb-4307-9994-c64c157773c3-1
00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:02.760
public, right, correct.

be24cf0f-9bc8-49b8-b220-032dd58f6a8e-0
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:09.000
But our low environments apart from tests
everything else is internal.

7eb8679a-cc8d-401e-b7a0-b61d247e5dc9-0
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.360
Yeah, it's internal, yes.

bd041279-8cd9-4da5-b62f-703f27db29c5-0
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.760
So, so it wouldn't work.

fd57fc95-00be-4ae4-9985-cef392051837-0
00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:17.935
So to get around that issue,
what we did was we created a public

fd57fc95-00be-4ae4-9985-cef392051837-1
00:28:17.935 --> 00:28:19.240
extension side.

d7ad7abe-e8bd-4e10-8b50-11abcf17b874-0
00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:19.680
Yep.

d5d80417-ce82-48f5-8a8c-374fd5f8a310-0
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.790
And all the environments refer to the
yeah,

d5d80417-ce82-48f5-8a8c-374fd5f8a310-1
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:29.440
public extension side to get the public B
to CS Yep, B to C files.

d2c8470b-4543-4a41-853f-c7a64e78a9fd-0
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.623
Like you can see the other environments
in here as well,

d2c8470b-4543-4a41-853f-c7a64e78a9fd-1
00:28:33.623 --> 00:28:35.440
like there's pre prod Yep.

bf207c41-f945-4eda-adf5-0a7a589cccd9-0
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.160
So the current production,
how it's accessing.

e081b399-0870-4d99-bcbf-ee399d7f565e-0
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.280
So production it has its like the
production site.

6387e1d7-ef1c-4a6e-9ae2-fe2bc587e615-0
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.525
Yeah, our our as per site,
it's has its template in it because

6387e1d7-ef1c-4a6e-9ae2-fe2bc587e615-1
00:28:48.525 --> 00:28:50.560
production site is public, right.

57c14066-8676-4c5e-ae5b-064ff718498f-0
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:50.920
OK.

b6921bea-431a-463c-b26b-14e19ffc0052-0
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:52.240
Yeah.

efe2fdb7-ac1f-4d53-b881-63b97dd6a029-0
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.680
So these things the only record for the
lower enrollment, Yeah.

302733b0-8a06-4b54-9503-44cdeb4ee178-0
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.702
So if you look at the production config,
right,

302733b0-8a06-4b54-9503-44cdeb4ee178-1
00:28:58.702 --> 00:29:01.600
So you can see the host is that's the
portal.

cec4369e-b9cc-44f5-b8ba-b53b1ffece89-0
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.320
Yeah, there's no extension site there.

15975f3f-957a-48ba-a451-f721dbb065ad-0
00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.600
So it uses its the portal itself.

b7053b3c-c41e-403d-96dc-42ef4720e4af-0
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.788
OK, So if if any changes comes,
we would deploy,

b7053b3c-c41e-403d-96dc-42ef4720e4af-1
00:29:11.788 --> 00:29:14.000
we only deploy that web template, right?

ec3bdcee-d97f-4d08-9cc0-0837126fa44e-0
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.160
So This site is not required for prod
release anyway?

19deee4c-b60b-401f-b24b-2c47e43517a6-0
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:17.960
No.

f7412ece-feae-40ba-86e2-0b62b6b228c7-0
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.920
So you don't have to worry about anything.

027d6b62-329d-485f-83d0-8eebcecd6cdb-0
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:26.267
So yeah, the changes,
you do it in these files here and you in

027d6b62-329d-485f-83d0-8eebcecd6cdb-1
00:29:26.267 --> 00:29:27.880
in a git branch.

d92c9ec0-27c9-42f8-9645-6e1c87357f93-0
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:34.181
You make the changes,
push and get it to code review like one

d92c9ec0-27c9-42f8-9645-6e1c87357f93-1
00:29:34.181 --> 00:29:40.480
of you guys do code review and then merge
pipeline will deploy.

c2dcf0e8-50e5-453d-8434-a6757b07ed57-0
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.920
So you don't have to do anything.

1e739b4b-6f81-47b0-bd38-b4fa88656051-0
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.400
It'll get deployed from environment to
environment.

f619b637-fe2e-49e9-b83e-c1e93d0ff9da-0
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.800
So this pipeline will deploy to prod site.

bc210bcf-73cb-4dd7-8b20-1a27a745576e-0
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:48.440
Yes.

c90b73a6-ab45-4b38-902a-f9019f4e6d72-0
00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.440
Multi factor HTML, yeah.

88750087-3c31-45d7-aec1-4c33ac24e10f-0
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.040
So all these get deployed.

b046b319-31a4-41e3-9b65-c3001b26a7d5-0
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
So we already automated all that.

a8d02893-2cad-4679-a4bb-25432056448d-0
00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.880
So deploying the HTML to the public side
is automatic as well.

01b4fdc8-9b15-4578-b9d9-90b9dbd89d6e-0
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:05.600
OK, yeah.

33e23b6d-a5d6-43e5-876e-985791dbe8b8-0
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.680
So that's the content side of it.

e40b4208-3439-48f7-8725-257d790dc3d4-0
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:23.503
And so let's get to so,
so user lands on the this sign up screen,

e40b4208-3439-48f7-8725-257d790dc3d4-1
00:30:23.503 --> 00:30:24.480
right?

8af7d0e6-58b6-459b-a10d-f22a9796dbf7-0
00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:34.292
So one of the things that we do is we do
get the user to enter the RN from the

8af7d0e6-58b6-459b-a10d-f22a9796dbf7-1
00:30:34.292 --> 00:30:43.305
email that they received and date of
birth and then we go and verify that that

8af7d0e6-58b6-459b-a10d-f22a9796dbf7-2
00:30:43.305 --> 00:30:44.560
ARN, right.

e8b153d6-6e83-448b-a230-72a558ca4774-0
00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:51.454
So,
so you can see the way that it happens is

e8b153d6-6e83-448b-a230-72a558ca4774-1
00:30:51.454 --> 00:30:58.360
there's a identity Web API and that Web
API calls database.

4a1d0b26-f313-48bd-b55b-1de88cd17769-0
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:10.840
So the way it works is so B to C so B to
C is a publicly available resource.

79449d28-bebd-4f73-9a7b-c92730d7e52f-0
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.560
So you can't put inside the Aspen network.

7df721d0-8b7a-42a6-aa48-9956cbba1822-0
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.880
It's it's in, it's in public, right?

f1e3680d-18ae-4676-af31-5cc42ef00dd9-0
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:27.431
So, so it's sort of expect this,
we can't make this API internal because

f1e3680d-18ae-4676-af31-5cc42ef00dd9-1
00:31:27.431 --> 00:31:35.794
otherwise then the this won't be able to
hit or or we can't really whitelist IP

f1e3680d-18ae-4676-af31-5cc42ef00dd9-2
00:31:35.794 --> 00:31:36.840
addresses.

a7b564a4-b68e-4261-9808-e12045bbf676-0
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:49.345
So the reason so for that reason,
so this is at the moment sitting inside

a7b564a4-b68e-4261-9808-e12045bbf676-1
00:31:49.345 --> 00:31:58.486
the ask for network,
but through the as go to our gateway,

a7b564a4-b68e-4261-9808-e12045bbf676-2
00:31:58.486 --> 00:32:02.360
we expose this to public.

f327479e-7c3a-4f16-9ad7-fc269f073d67-0
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:09.240
So you can see, yeah,
I'm still logged in here.

9cd436d4-8f64-4a78-8f50-f2a013b6fbb8-0
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:56.580
Let's switch back to the so you can see
in.

3431695c-f6c7-4232-8961-a143a965f397-0
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:04.860
So this is your logic app and that
resource group, right?

0073b464-1881-42a0-9d8d-e96b480d8251-0
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:10.820
For each environment we have ACIM
resource group.

1fcdec44-483d-406d-b9f6-850fc7f16a91-0
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:18.360
So CIM resource group is where all the
identity resources are.

61af2a10-74ff-4ca7-8a61-f3b7309aee96-0
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.480
So these where the API is.

04f9106a-5976-4971-a7d5-e8491c0c38b2-0
00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.040
So as I said, API is within the network.

8a3fc9c3-7dbd-4251-b623-e44b5344069e-0
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.520
It's it's internal only.

a157601a-036a-4de8-a1f1-2adfed962277-0
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:34.368
But if you try to hit this, this address,
you, you say within the network,

a157601a-036a-4de8-a1f1-2adfed962277-1
00:33:34.368 --> 00:33:39.600
you you will be able to hit this because
you VPN.

11ce2392-df5b-47e3-ac42-81d95a2765ff-0
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.840
But if you're not VPN,
you won't be able to reach this.

bbc25eb3-9215-4613-af8a-21f7644eba8c-0
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:53.200
So you need to access that using POST.

9d3da8eb-053d-49db-8fd0-a32136da18d1-0
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:04.200
So if I go to devs the API yeah.

8a78ca6d-f5e4-4e32-9956-198975cec7ae-0
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.600
And in the API URL,
so you always need to use the

8a78ca6d-f5e4-4e32-9956-198975cec7ae-1
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.400
dnsdevenvironment.api.aspa.gov dot AU.

35dd1aae-d742-40b8-a5b1-b84eea610b44-0
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.640
So that's a dark so that that OK.

de8bef0c-4b84-4840-be2a-7c616cba6a35-0
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:29.360
The other part is so,
so now the API is in public, right?

55264768-adf7-468f-9867-e4964fbdecce-0
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.960
So we need a way to secure the API.

3391562e-a37f-4f88-ba49-80b56736b5a7-0
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.240
So we don't want want anyone to be able
to access the API.

1b726fed-1a3b-4b55-9aa6-69e1b42fcd65-0
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.520
We want to secure it.

05207644-c249-4acf-b8fb-a2572e38276b-0
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.400
So the way that we secure it using using
oath.

32e845ff-8e75-46e4-a1f5-bfe872995361-0
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.120
So I'm not sure whether you're familiar
with that.

a1464679-8045-4c5a-ac00-53ec0de67ac7-0
00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:52.240
So you need to provide access token to
the APIAPI validates access token.

f54aba12-1881-4f37-830d-3d61cdfdcd88-0
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:59.469
If the token is valid,
then API allows whoever the consumer is

f54aba12-1881-4f37-830d-3d61cdfdcd88-1
00:34:59.469 --> 00:35:02.760
requesting to access the API.

7871814b-ba79-4d91-9828-54bf29e2013f-0
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:12.200
So so when the B to C So what happens is
you saw the HTML right?

c44bdbeb-1720-4dbe-b441-80b264339fc7-0
00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:25.089
And when you do submit, when you do,
when you hit, when you hit sign up button,

c44bdbeb-1720-4dbe-b441-80b264339fc7-1
00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:33.187
the request well,
so B to C front end will make a request

c44bdbeb-1720-4dbe-b441-80b264339fc7-2
00:35:33.187 --> 00:35:35.840
to B to C back end.

6af7032f-0a2c-482b-81be-47d81af023fa-0
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.520
So that's hosted in somewhere in B to C
somewhere in Azure, right.

a1e23b8d-aa18-483f-b446-5442eae4b0cc-0
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.360
So we don't know where what happens in
there.

af9774b6-ded7-4498-9de7-019bf0aaf018-0
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:51.820
So what what happens is that policy get
executed and the policy is from the B to

af9774b6-ded7-4498-9de7-019bf0aaf018-1
00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:57.240
C back end is the one who's going to call
the the ABR.

d2de6e21-6ac0-49da-95a5-73a1467d081d-0
00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.379
So for BTC policy,
the BTC back end to call the API,

d2de6e21-6ac0-49da-95a5-73a1467d081d-1
00:36:03.379 --> 00:36:05.480
it needs access token.

08a88f9a-0bd5-4ab5-80e9-be34879391aa-0
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:16.148
So, so I'll so,
so we use you have registration to get

08a88f9a-0bd5-4ab5-80e9-be34879391aa-1
00:36:16.148 --> 00:36:18.680
the access token.

eb36b513-3f50-45c9-b9c3-ccf8079c2e46-0
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:29.832
So if you go to policy keys,
you can see escort entity API, client ID,

eb36b513-3f50-45c9-b9c3-ccf8079c2e46-1
00:36:29.832 --> 00:36:33.800
escort identity API secret.

4ecd2304-9ab4-4a19-badf-2bc854f5cb25-0
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:40.569
So what it does is policy will get the
client ID and the secret,

4ecd2304-9ab4-4a19-badf-2bc854f5cb25-1
00:36:40.569 --> 00:36:47.784
it'll talk to Azure ID and you will get
access token and then we'll call the

4ecd2304-9ab4-4a19-badf-2bc854f5cb25-2
00:36:47.784 --> 00:36:48.440
RNGAPI.

c123c9d1-971d-44e2-9aee-fc8840dbaa5e-0
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.320
So do you configure the API within the
policy itself, Tanuka?

363b836b-9a71-47c2-9daa-ef50a3df211b-0
00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:59.043
Like how do you how do you configure like
which API this policy is calling that you

363b836b-9a71-47c2-9daa-ef50a3df211b-1
00:36:59.043 --> 00:37:01.360
will be giving in the Jason there?

65e408e8-2d69-4919-90bb-0d54f9ec9fe4-0
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:02.440
Yeah.

7196fd5d-2ce9-4c03-85fb-65bfc268da6f-0
00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.800
So, so this is just the configuration,
right?

9f15feb7-0180-497a-b643-8e6e0c0b4f78-0
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.200
This is this OK, that's the configuration.

bef242a2-4e25-4765-9b19-30a9e0f7b907-0
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:13.839
The implementation,
the way it calls is for example,

bef242a2-4e25-4765-9b19-30a9e0f7b907-1
00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:18.840
if I go to I'll I'll,
I'll do another session.

fe61f3e2-f92d-4e05-b08b-d7befb838899-0
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:25.489
Yeah, yeah, this to answer your question,
I'll briefly go through this,

fe61f3e2-f92d-4e05-b08b-d7befb838899-1
00:37:25.489 --> 00:37:29.442
but so you can see, so it'll call this,
I mean,

fe61f3e2-f92d-4e05-b08b-d7befb838899-2
00:37:29.442 --> 00:37:33.560
you can consider this as sort of like a
function.

e48f7e1d-a726-4c27-b5f9-fd5182d78b1d-0
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.160
It'll call this function all API to
verify.

3f17e036-2b16-453a-9577-b1a8fa1a149f-0
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.120
OK.

5f2b184b-5970-46a7-a387-61d572cf9d4e-0
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.320
So then again, this is Identity API URL,
so which is getting from the config, OK.

f5bcf22f-74b6-4d36-90d9-476feb411d07-0
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.520
And then this is the URLAPIURL, right?

960fc458-7533-4e6b-a824-e90bab179ceb-0
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:58.680
So it's going to call the impacted
individual verify route of the API, Yeah.

3c99548d-28e0-4070-b5dc-64cf7039d62f-0
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.520
And pass the token, Right.

b352a618-4836-4b48-862f-3b7ae352adc4-0
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.080
OK, Yep.

7693e4ae-aa9f-4eb7-9b8a-cdf8b43da705-0
00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:09.057
And then this is the body,
So it passes the ARN and the date of

7693e4ae-aa9f-4eb7-9b8a-cdf8b43da705-1
00:38:09.057 --> 00:38:09.520
birth.

92a41f02-09ea-463b-92f8-78727c60fbf2-0
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.920
Yeah, in the body.

f55ff1e3-c9f0-407d-bea0-691e5d60743b-0
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.840
So OK, Yeah.

37ecba95-c026-4498-8bfd-2877af4d6518-0
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.400
So the token won't get sent in the body.

8c0fb054-0f73-41d3-8a5d-b6c9cac0c3b4-0
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.800
It'll the BTC policy will put the token
into the header.

82bf8454-f43e-4008-9ba4-bd21cb512913-0
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.000
So that's how it get called like for
example.

be633c36-a398-4912-959f-d08e105759d1-0
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.720
So API code is also in this repo.

dceace4f-a15d-4184-b7e7-4e9068ced89a-0
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.600
So you can see the the structure of this
repo, right?

5693298e-ce1b-42be-a4d3-332b7fa816f1-0
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.600
So the first folder is B to C policies.

d5d9ef60-b408-4c81-9d53-54e24bd175b3-0
00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.213
Anything,
anything to do with the policies is in

d5d9ef60-b408-4c81-9d53-54e24bd175b3-1
00:38:39.213 --> 00:38:39.480
here.

b1461f38-5a7c-44e4-be9f-5347d368adb1-0
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:42.920
And you can see.

8a7262ca-ee20-4aa4-81ae-da6512b44e17-0
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.560
So these are all the policies, right?

b6b2c361-cd57-4ca4-afc2-34d0c06de9f4-0
00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.560
And and their hierarchy in here and
there's a scripts folder.

99d846cf-e83b-47d3-b2bf-d44080a5cb0f-0
00:38:52.560 --> 00:39:05.000
Scripts folder helps to deploy these
policies into B to C So all it does is.

c4187898-f1a9-4e7f-b4cf-3fd0fcb9317c-0
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.636
So like for example, prepare,
what it does is it reads A,

c4187898-f1a9-4e7f-b4cf-3fd0fcb9317c-1
00:39:10.636 --> 00:39:16.960
it gets a policy XML and you can see
policy XML have placeholders, right?

9cbf76e6-02dd-4742-9026-b5b5ad008da1-0
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.868
So some placeholder values and it finds
the environment config and replace the

9cbf76e6-02dd-4742-9026-b5b5ad008da1-1
00:39:26.868 --> 00:39:31.920
policy with the placeholders replace,
right?

7220b411-2b7a-4be0-8869-8b8c88efac96-0
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:44.804
And sort of like preprocessing and then
the deploy file this have the code to go

7220b411-2b7a-4be0-8869-8b8c88efac96-1
00:39:44.804 --> 00:39:52.280
and deploy the policies into into here,
right?

40c8b18a-9093-4faf-a363-c6069a19ed70-0
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.480
Maybe,
maybe maybe let me show you something.

c89a371d-e194-4417-9fef-980520110a7a-0
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:17.953
So this is so I've got to so I can run it
from the pipeline or I can pipeline take

c89a371d-e194-4417-9fef-980520110a7a-1
00:40:17.953 --> 00:40:19.520
a little bit of time.

9f7dd76a-14ab-435c-92b0-a2f1a0c19965-0
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.320
So So what I would do is I would just.

944ee893-bbef-41f7-88d2-212b9bad7fa5-0
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.800
Prepare the policies locally and then
deploy from my machine.

5d61fef3-3157-4b08-910d-97bbf5008096-0
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:39.094
But this is what I said,
you don't if to start doing development

5d61fef3-3157-4b08-910d-97bbf5008096-1
00:40:39.094 --> 00:40:47.444
you don't really need access to the B to
C tenant because you can use the

5d61fef3-3157-4b08-910d-97bbf5008096-2
00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:50.040
appraisation to deploy.

ce52c4fa-a5ff-4f6b-b821-9650cb14f7ad-0
00:40:51.560 --> 00:41:01.000
So what this does is so if I go,
let me dev, let me delete.

65be1191-fad9-4004-b6c7-6a5d2ffc3c3f-0
00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:09.304
So this is delete so so if you can see
this command so so there's some

65be1191-fad9-4004-b6c7-6a5d2ffc3c3f-1
00:41:09.304 --> 00:41:10.640
environment.

97d19ec9-3da5-4981-b99d-ec617a3f39d1-0
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:17.400
So we don't one of the principles that we
do is anything secret.

2447872e-e847-483a-a8b1-cb5dd947a612-0
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.600
We don't put into the code.

1c471f9c-1a56-412b-ad40-8761c61ca74e-0
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.920
We either put it to a keyboard or put as
pipeline variables.

cf0da8ad-d4c8-43c6-930f-aa5d5cf4dbde-0
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:34.818
So for example Application Insights
connection string we don't put into the

cf0da8ad-d4c8-43c6-930f-aa5d5cf4dbde-1
00:41:34.818 --> 00:41:40.960
code because it's not good practise to
check in secrets so.

189ee64d-bd5c-4258-b128-6a7de338b722-0
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:49.360
So for me to run the preparation I need
to provide the connection string.

c3216df1-6c70-472b-ac21-039f64de5929-0
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:56.043
So I provide the connection string using
environment variable and you can see I'm

c3216df1-6c70-472b-ac21-039f64de5929-1
00:41:56.043 --> 00:42:02.320
running the prepare B to C policies and I
specify the environment as dev so.

92b120a2-a312-4702-9c90-c34b90a5fba5-0
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:10.400
So if I run this so I can see dev got
created and these policies are now all

92b120a2-a312-4702-9c90-c34b90a5fba5-1
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:18.240
compiled and placeholders have been
removed and ready in a ready state to be

92b120a2-a312-4702-9c90-c34b90a5fba5-2
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:24.960
deployed onto AB to C tenant and then
what you can do is you can.

33fa696d-ad0b-4f8e-80cd-54619ab452e9-0
00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.320
So what, what, what, what is it?

5ee658cc-3c58-419e-b6b9-889d658d24e4-0
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:07.554
What's doing now is it's reading the
policies from the dev environment and it

5ee658cc-3c58-419e-b6b9-889d658d24e4-1
00:43:07.554 --> 00:43:09.080
just uploads.

d6c9e531-dae9-4b15-94cb-e6096d1330ba-0
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.787
So now if you browse to it,
whatever you've done in dev,

d6c9e531-dae9-4b15-94cb-e6096d1330ba-1
00:43:14.787 --> 00:43:18.800
he's already published into the dev
environment.

dab8ee5c-5499-423e-9634-0afcc47b3622-0
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.782
You should be able to test out your
changes there so you can do your

dab8ee5c-5499-423e-9634-0afcc47b3622-1
00:43:23.782 --> 00:43:28.969
development locally and push it using
this and then test using portal or

dab8ee5c-5499-423e-9634-0afcc47b3622-2
00:43:28.969 --> 00:43:29.680
something.

1996d5d4-281f-47c5-8130-e5cc79cd60db-0
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.080
If you're going to get started now,
you don't need your own access.

7306562a-ed5d-4546-9bf5-5061032ad3d2-0
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:45.161
And one the other thing is any PowerShell
you want to run locally,

7306562a-ed5d-4546-9bf5-5061032ad3d2-1
00:43:45.161 --> 00:43:55.560
it needs so you can see there's a big
BLOB of text at the end of the PowerShell.

511c9c48-32ca-45b9-bc41-ce67714f1e5e-0
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.120
You can't.

ef144e24-610a-4bf3-befc-e980604f7330-0
00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:05.294
Ascot is not allowed Aston PowerShell to
be run on a developer machine without

ef144e24-610a-4bf3-befc-e980604f7330-1
00:44:05.294 --> 00:44:08.600
being signed by a Ascot certificate.

bc37fb8b-a70d-4745-a8ca-cbbfdd1b6353-0
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.680
So that's one of the things that you need
to do.

90821400-1921-4d36-9894-ae89d7253db1-0
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:20.400
You need to require,
you need to request access to that,

90821400-1921-4d36-9894-ae89d7253db1-1
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:27.120
that policy and then sorry,
not policy that certificate.

e4808500-f596-4196-be8e-2429d8c80050-0
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.680
That certificate will get installed onto
your machine then.

f3f722aa-6a4f-4294-94ca-0b09c89cb3d6-0
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:38.480
So you can sign using commands the
policies and then.

a8dfafd9-ca48-4fdc-b25a-7590d4490eef-0
00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.840
So you only need to do that if you change
in the PowerShell.

bf303c81-fbab-4fc2-8af9-dcb334acb777-0
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.765
But if you're not changing PowerShell to
run it,

bf303c81-fbab-4fc2-8af9-dcb334acb777-1
00:44:45.765 --> 00:44:47.880
you don't have you don't need the
certificate.

4e0b1557-b4ac-4410-8e68-ba83870950c8-0
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:54.080
Certificate only needed if you're
changing it so that need to be requested

4e0b1557-b4ac-4410-8e68-ba83870950c8-1
00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.080
certificate to be installed on your
machine.

38d18c43-8f41-4892-b5fa-f62ed10c5f63-0
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:07.685
Yeah,
I think I these guys are the one who

38d18c43-8f41-4892-b5fa-f62ed10c5f63-1
00:45:07.685 --> 00:45:21.622
installed certificate onto my machine so
I can sign and develop PowerShell,

38d18c43-8f41-4892-b5fa-f62ed10c5f63-2
00:45:21.622 --> 00:45:23.640
PowerShell.

44190956-add5-446c-b0d5-55b9194c5d1f-0
00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.320
So going back to that content,
content is the same, right?

68ba44a9-a481-40ed-a33a-49f0b44fec69-0
00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:33.252
So,
so you can see the content is in this

68ba44a9-a481-40ed-a33a-49f0b44fec69-1
00:45:33.252 --> 00:45:42.434
folder, but so there are some,
there are some PowerShell, sorry,

68ba44a9-a481-40ed-a33a-49f0b44fec69-2
00:45:42.434 --> 00:45:47.520
there are some PowerShell to deploy.

5ad8aa15-5d95-49c3-85be-a5f2091fe672-0
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:58.662
So let let's see, right, Right now,
if you go to dev in moment,

5ad8aa15-5d95-49c3-85be-a5f2091fe672-1
00:45:58.662 --> 00:46:05.800
if I go to dev in moment, it's dev, yeah.

6ed78b55-625c-4690-af39-a189ba35e3d7-0
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:33.440
Search for impacted in individual sign in
sign up.

d8d79bec-d5cb-4a14-9663-412325756599-0
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:53.547
So I'm just browsing to that policy that
so this this has the old study this this

d8d79bec-d5cb-4a14-9663-412325756599-1
00:46:53.547 --> 00:46:59.450
is the production version, right?

43cba9eb-70a4-4cf6-b155-5e16128f60ec-0
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:11.094
So you can do deploy the HTML HTML
templates to your web template in the

43cba9eb-70a4-4cf6-b155-5e16128f60ec-1
00:47:11.094 --> 00:47:15.960
extension side using that script.

75e4e1b9-d575-4a99-b57a-907396663f4d-0
00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:28.366
So there's another separate appreciation
and a secret application to deploy the

75e4e1b9-d575-4a99-b57a-907396663f4d-1
00:47:28.366 --> 00:47:31.680
HTML template into the.

7f267873-afb9-46d5-b4d3-accfb96a3022-0
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.000
Let's see whether this this works.

36486b5a-5644-4168-a217-e92152f50578-0
00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:44.714
So now it's you can see the content of
the HTML template getting deployed onto

36486b5a-5644-4168-a217-e92152f50578-1
00:47:44.714 --> 00:47:45.480
the web.

54aac43e-f7fc-4968-b420-4d2053dedc23-0
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.880
It's getting updated onto the web
templates.

279a2b5e-10c1-4fa6-af92-a70c5ff5c880-0
00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:57.080
So if I refresh I should see if the
templates are updated correctly.

cf675170-a5ad-48b3-b495-bc7614a81b09-0
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:03.960
Yeah.

ba45baa4-76ad-425f-adc6-d8195fc9b9a3-0
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.600
So you can see the new styling appeared,
right.

1d7d94e5-f317-4e9a-81d7-eb2effb155e3-0
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:11.240
So this is the restyled new layer.

16bbec1d-fd2a-436e-a62e-377323f8cd96-0
00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.080
So that because I had the production
version deployed on to dev before.

9cab0c44-0e32-4236-a283-c7e99cdf0173-0
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:20.240
So this is the RMA version.

c4317558-854b-47c5-92f7-4ee7a9d2811c-0
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.800
I just deployed the RMA version to dev.

ea6bedbe-b671-4d18-8418-dec4d8fd437e-0
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.440
So it reflects the styling.

ce8cb351-8f5b-4916-a57b-84bc3a0bb820-0
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.680
So you it's it's it's version controlled,
right.

13639b98-acd8-4072-8295-139367dfe053-0
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.400
So you have the flexibility to go back
and forth.

288b7254-5425-40b6-869a-adde7a1b8e78-0
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:43.174
If you want to fix a bug in Qi,
you can go back to the Qi starting and

288b7254-5425-40b6-869a-adde7a1b8e78-1
00:48:43.174 --> 00:48:44.760
then move forward.

1691c315-36e0-4f24-80a0-8f8aabf8b16d-0
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.800
We will say, yeah, yeah.

72cb669a-5b8a-4a0b-8a29-3abc18ad2fd0-0
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.560
So I was talking about the folder
structure, right?

bee9bf58-2637-4287-b821-0438f3010bd0-0
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:07.400
So that's all the B to C stuff is in B to
C policies folder and the pipelines.

f6b83ca0-bfa9-43ed-b45b-40e88065f3c3-0
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.320
So there are two pipelines.

330db193-3ef0-4219-96b2-06683273a6e4-0
00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.960
1 pipeline is to deploy the API.

a3ae453c-bd6b-4d01-8429-61fcd7fa0b68-0
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.840
The other pipeline is to deploy B to C
I'll get to that later.

748ad77f-7eec-453c-bde0-f63fefa0ac6c-0
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:26.160
But that's where all the pipeline code is
and this is where the API is, right?

be492de1-e351-4fc5-b80c-b4de4ff60854-0
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:33.480
So we saw that in one of these, yeah.

f39180d4-f022-42c6-ac20-1a3ef98e1f08-0
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:40.680
So this it calls impacted individual
verify route.

893c1a90-725c-41b1-9c16-f03a09e889b6-0
00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:47.904
So if you go back to the API,
so apicodethis.net right,

893c1a90-725c-41b1-9c16-f03a09e889b6-1
00:49:47.904 --> 00:49:54.600
So you have controllers,
so there's 2 controllers, right?

b600dc69-f375-4ff0-9930-a3eec3d7c850-0
00:49:54.680 --> 00:50:01.920
So because you can see on a invite only
branch.

d9c7b359-ee3c-43c1-9b27-0063d03fd991-0
00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.240
So maybe I'll I'll get to the source
control part a little bit later.

866a2a63-ef5f-439f-b02b-4043aafa3d03-0
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.480
Do you guys have experience with git?

bfa05e73-f395-4a60-86ec-49088ebbf2c6-0
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.778
You know how git branching works and we
do,

bfa05e73-f395-4a60-86ec-49088ebbf2c6-1
00:50:12.778 --> 00:50:18.200
but I have never created like a repo and
then try to associate the lookout.

9e92b4a1-acf8-42a2-8a68-a3b2730fbed7-0
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.186
Earlier projects we used to do the create
new branches and then check in into the

9e92b4a1-acf8-42a2-8a68-a3b2730fbed7-1
00:50:24.186 --> 00:50:25.920
main, Yeah, and then deploy it.

67096841-3c3d-4edc-b6ab-efda7e8fbb23-0
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.120
But yeah,
haven't created anything from scratch.

a332c1cc-d748-40af-8736-e9a1e2245d96-0
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:30.000
Cool.

4976a804-38b0-41c1-b13b-7ed159252bc9-0
00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.560
I'll get to the source control part in
another session.

0984a62e-fe66-4218-a005-88b1759e88ca-0
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.080
But what I'm saying is the main branch
have the different code.

cc630ebe-85d6-4fb5-8f10-e497dd22d21a-0
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.662
But yeah,
So what I'm what I'm demoing is the

cc630ebe-85d6-4fb5-8f10-e497dd22d21a-1
00:50:41.662 --> 00:50:42.680
invite only branch.

f0d52699-e35c-4576-aa18-49e71aed78ae-0
00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:48.992
So this is what I showed just in the
meeting before that we have the when you

f0d52699-e35c-4576-aa18-49e71aed78ae-1
00:50:48.992 --> 00:50:53.038
now when you sign up,
when you browse to sign up,

f0d52699-e35c-4576-aa18-49e71aed78ae-2
00:50:53.038 --> 00:50:59.512
the first thing it get shown is for the
user to enter the ARN and then the sign

f0d52699-e35c-4576-aa18-49e71aed78ae-3
00:50:59.512 --> 00:51:00.160
up part.

270fc9c4-a02e-4244-9976-55d862b4f532-0
00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.680
So these that that branch.

7db9444d-6201-4224-95e8-d1536d0e49c4-0
00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:06.360
That's why there's more to it than what
we're seeing.

dd45caa7-9b18-4382-b164-bc23b64502d5-0
00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.838
So,
so going back to this branch is like your

dd45caa7-9b18-4382-b164-bc23b64502d5-1
00:51:08.838 --> 00:51:10.240
development branch, is it?

57280e8c-88bf-4fe4-8270-10d781ec4bdc-0
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.760
This is like a dev branch that you work
on.

6fe1e212-33bf-4c4b-911f-27dc99826dff-0
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.000
Is this branch what you're showing?

77585760-5fba-4266-bdaf-9f1f46cab4a4-0
00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:25.320
So what we do rather is we take the trunk
base strategy.

71be0f2e-69f3-4637-b6c8-2c5a57049f9d-0
00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:29.709
So that means so we have the main and
there's no there's nothing called

71be0f2e-69f3-4637-b6c8-2c5a57049f9d-1
00:51:29.709 --> 00:51:30.720
development, right?

214f45dd-352c-4dfa-88d5-e11bac667e06-0
00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.160
So, so I have feature branches.

4b5da835-1f3b-4226-89a3-054446d4a0e5-0
00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:33.680
Yeah.

980e3a66-8656-4bb0-aa68-46958969ef02-0
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:38.846
So invite only the feature branch,
then maybe I'll just so there,

980e3a66-8656-4bb0-aa68-46958969ef02-1
00:51:38.846 --> 00:51:41.240
there are lots of branches, right?

bd052023-9c62-488b-9a10-66fab3c46dc3-0
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:47.840
Because I'll be working on a lot of sort
of features.

90f57619-2b2d-44df-9361-59a97b133878-0
00:51:49.120 --> 00:52:01.320
So if I go to I think Pradeep can provide
access to these E triple to you guys.

82338091-2cc6-4a3e-80f8-8d1eb5c8b740-0
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:06.345
I think the one that you gave us
yesterday, we were able to access it,

82338091-2cc6-4a3e-80f8-8d1eb5c8b740-1
00:52:06.345 --> 00:52:06.840
I think.

5fdd4130-e285-43be-b858-5298ca22ad88-0
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:07.520
Nice.

b524cc69-ccc4-4e94-ada1-da0e9408e0d2-0
00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.840
The one, yeah, nice.

fd7fce69-f110-48ef-9282-a837a68a6160-0
00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:17.560
So CIM, so you can see when you go to it,
there are so many different branches.

62aa99db-fc41-4a94-8243-f7c9dacf5d0a-0
00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.040
So there's a capture branch.

ab7ebb41-bc34-4390-84dd-c9b9d41e4313-0
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.016
So,
so we have all the capture implementation

ab7ebb41-bc34-4390-84dd-c9b9d41e4313-1
00:52:24.016 --> 00:52:24.400
there.

905b2aac-c1e5-46c7-9b9e-eb38cfed65db-0
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:30.555
So I think Pradeep if Pradeep is there,
but if we at some point we need to get

905b2aac-c1e5-46c7-9b9e-eb38cfed65db-1
00:52:30.555 --> 00:52:36.903
this merge and deployed onto production
because I think the cyber said capture is

905b2aac-c1e5-46c7-9b9e-eb38cfed65db-2
00:52:36.903 --> 00:52:37.600
required.

03563be0-0cc0-44a1-a163-595b4eb44f1a-0
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:42.130
But yeah,
all the capture changes are in this

03563be0-0cc0-44a1-a163-595b4eb44f1a-1
00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:48.400
branch and it's ready to be deployed and
edit profile, I've got started on it.

64f0720b-39f1-4dca-9e85-a37ad331f093-0
00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:53.088
Edit profile change,
I'll delete this change content path,

64f0720b-39f1-4dca-9e85-a37ad331f093-1
00:52:53.088 --> 00:52:54.360
it's not needed.

306d7157-2fae-4847-931e-6bc180fc934d-0
00:52:54.800 --> 00:53:02.240
So this Google branch is the POCID 400
point ID check.

e20f3451-6659-4fd4-95d8-3eba7c4ab6ef-0
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.160
So this is that simulation that we're
talking about, 400 point check.

1c22759d-aa0f-41ea-8d6f-1ee04f240be3-0
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:11.560
So instead of having my Idi have it as
Google.

a242fbf7-0e77-480f-984e-443c410bac9d-0
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.640
So that's that just I'll delete the
import POC.

767b5398-c590-41fc-9c00-b8b04bee6334-0
00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:25.768
We don't need that invitation only is the
one I was just showing partition dev

767b5398-c590-41fc-9c00-b8b04bee6334-1
00:53:25.768 --> 00:53:30.160
environment is that dev DEVINT branch.

916cbe39-a267-47ec-93c7-2a5b2e5c5190-0
00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:38.928
So we need I'll get that merge so they'll
get deleted before I leave audio Co sign

916cbe39-a267-47ec-93c7-2a5b2e5c5190-1
00:53:38.928 --> 00:53:39.240
up.

0e169c15-5508-4fe4-86cd-0f1b3ed30d74-0
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.914
So,
so I don't know whether you can recall I

0e169c15-5508-4fe4-86cd-0f1b3ed30d74-1
00:53:42.914 --> 00:53:45.920
presented three options for sign up,
right.

bc1df947-046e-4112-bb7d-00e39b638f2e-0
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:51.064
So one is being the generic and the
second is the hybrid and the third is the

bc1df947-046e-4112-bb7d-00e39b638f2e-1
00:53:51.064 --> 00:53:52.120
invitation only.

7b1a61f0-b02e-49a6-884d-a2fa4c941fa9-0
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:58.750
So if you ever wanted to go back to that
hybrid from invitation,

7b1a61f0-b02e-49a6-884d-a2fa4c941fa9-1
00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:01.960
only hybrid changes are in this branch.

52d57dc8-fcce-440d-bcba-815d3cd8d882-0
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.920
So everything is of main branch.

ce725bf5-91cb-4ab2-ba57-9aae38f3673b-0
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:14.120
So,
so we only merge to main when we're ready.

3a6fdae3-a2ac-432f-ba1f-65b4713faa21-0
00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.160
The code is ready to be deployed onto
production.

9fc5240d-3076-47f2-99e6-f52e97eee15c-0
00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:29.410
So yeah,
we use the the the trunk base branching

9fc5240d-3076-47f2-99e6-f52e97eee15c-1
00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:31.080
strategy.

fad9c401-7392-4ee5-abfb-be6b18a75f70-0
00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:41.120
I think we're pretty much up for time.

f0a54440-4215-420e-a96e-d9d0b5a5214b-0
00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.524
Just have a look at the if you have
access to code,

f0a54440-4215-420e-a96e-d9d0b5a5214b-1
00:54:45.524 --> 00:54:52.299
just have a look at the code base and
just once you go maybe because see do you

f0a54440-4215-420e-a96e-d9d0b5a5214b-2
00:54:52.299 --> 00:54:58.143
you don't have access to the you don't
have a_a account, right Yeah,

f0a54440-4215-420e-a96e-d9d0b5a5214b-3
00:54:58.143 --> 00:55:00.600
I've I've requested the yeah.

2efd289d-f711-4449-8c3e-78750845d126-0
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.080
So today morning I've requested it.

d77eafe8-5fb4-44fe-b40c-03f0fa9cd7ae-0
00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.720
I have the code access, but yeah.

d924457f-b143-4862-9d6c-9c179728a8b6-0
00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:10.894
So if you have or maybe like next time we
catch up,

d924457f-b143-4862-9d6c-9c179728a8b6-1
00:55:10.894 --> 00:55:14.292
we'll pull down the code and maybe get
the,

d924457f-b143-4862-9d6c-9c179728a8b6-2
00:55:14.292 --> 00:55:20.777
I think maybe we should try it on Radha's
machine because Radha already got_account

d924457f-b143-4862-9d6c-9c179728a8b6-3
00:55:20.777 --> 00:55:23.480
and have access to Azure resources.

546ea3ee-ce8d-4f5d-ab5e-ee3c03f609cb-0
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:30.947
We can maybe get things,
set it up and then get things running on,

546ea3ee-ce8d-4f5d-ab5e-ee3c03f609cb-1
00:55:30.947 --> 00:55:33.360
on, on your local machines.

c6ffcc4b-bcb7-4868-b8d4-173b5189c1ce-0
00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.840
So if you want to make any changes,
you you can make changes.

caaea070-91f7-40d6-9b5b-1a39c307ebe2-0
00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.200
Yep, Yep.

c6ea7a31-c78d-4b93-85e8-64f328ae8635-0
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.240
We'll book something tomorrow, then occur.

98b6bc03-8c60-4993-b6be-e88b8a8c82eb-0
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:47.760
Yeah, I'll, I'll feel free to book any.
