7f77b05a-0671-47a0-80f6-f62213597464-0
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.840
Right, let me share my screen,
maybe I'll share my whole screen.

6f27ad1e-bd0a-4148-bff5-24a61e95a119-0
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.120
Can you guys see this or these tools?

bd3ac67a-cf61-430b-894f-55d779a5ebc8-0
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.240
Yep.

f7f897c7-1766-4856-9ed9-39bab091db28-0
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.080
Would you be able to maximise it then ago?

8facc124-2d65-441c-b59b-aeda4bc5b3df-0
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:29.520
Maybe because I'm on my big screen,
just I don't know what I can do.

d53a611c-49e9-419b-99d7-0bfc1cc4eea2-0
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.960
No, I can't.

a244ab59-9cbc-4e89-935b-3fc548323562-0
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.000
Maybe I'll reach on to my other screen.

f2042dfe-e4cc-4251-80fd-96a86860c8cf-0
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.600
Yeah.

5c5d6be7-3fc3-426e-a535-6eedd63c9c0c-0
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.600
Can you guys see now?

08697b08-974b-44ee-bfcb-bcb7c0b0f464-0
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.920
Better.

35df351f-27d7-41b2-bf6b-4816f25001f9-0
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.400
Yeah.

8f10744b-a456-4e2b-8569-265ac963331b-0
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.960
Better.

8287b07e-e225-43f2-b670-4f84c6b5cf33-0
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.840
Yeah.

82f20db4-a305-47b6-ac67-7df48d402c57-0
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.160
All right.

b633d77c-1e3c-4235-8e68-c52da69cc4d0-0
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.480
Cool.

d1e2f2e7-71e3-4102-bb51-cbdb1a7308e2-0
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.440
So.

1984357f-2bf0-4930-863b-1b1d44e11f69-0
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.040
So the API.

74190482-e49a-4bcf-ae52-64a437592338-0
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:10.320
So I think we were on API the other day,
so I'll bring on my BS code here.

39ac56b7-1583-4717-97a9-be2dc2cc8c9d-0
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.640
So the API code is in here.

06c889cb-af39-462f-b6a9-fe106c935fde-0
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:32.204
So I think going back to the diagram,
so you can see the API,

06c889cb-af39-462f-b6a9-fe106c935fde-1
00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:36.720
API talks to database.

0250828c-fea1-4a3f-804a-2cb567305ac0-0
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.200
So I'll talk about Azure a little bit.

0ff66890-cffb-42ae-8d7c-e1ce4473ecc3-0
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:52.650
Let me go back to my browser.

6512563e-3c50-4319-8c60-547fd3808a84-0
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.450
So this is, for example,
this is the Azure resource group that

6512563e-3c50-4319-8c60-547fd3808a84-1
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.650
we've got for.

2e9cf991-1ebb-4070-b71d-412ecfb292d2-0
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.970
So we got a separate resource group for
Sam.

4ec8a506-adfa-46b0-8f16-24565533cc50-0
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.320
So this is the dev SIM resource group.

39c23dd2-2445-4a73-bd09-f95aa619c37c-0
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.917
So the, the,
the there's a lot of networking stuff

39c23dd2-2445-4a73-bd09-f95aa619c37c-1
00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:13.080
here that you don't need to worry about.

23426dd8-2962-493a-8e4b-18f059d77a2e-0
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.120
That's all Azure will.

7e15ac3e-3bd3-43b7-8b07-dbe0eecadb5b-0
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.840
You know, Azure team will take care of it.

cf4b6a0a-7dfa-482a-aaaf-86a08249c512-0
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.320
I think even the app Service plan you
don't need to worry about.

a1859e62-278b-455c-b272-89d31b3fd2b5-0
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.378
I think the resources that you need to
worry about is this is the app service,

a1859e62-278b-455c-b272-89d31b3fd2b5-1
00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:37.080
so this is where the API is hosted and so
this API talks to this keyboard.

f5ddec39-11ad-4fa3-91cf-c486b5881860-0
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.825
So all the secrets that it needs to
integrate,

f5ddec39-11ad-4fa3-91cf-c486b5881860-1
00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:54.680
it reads secrets from the keyboard and
the way it authenticates to keyboard.

aae9f492-a427-4cb1-a6d8-25a3d8b98676-0
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.400
So you need to authenticate.

527f588b-9478-4c12-85e4-4f198bd5b86f-0
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.960
When you connect into keyword you need to
authenticate to it.

906245bd-8ab8-4627-b1ef-81043381f427-0
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:08.657
So the way it connects is using Managed
Service identity and the API logs to

906245bd-8ab8-4627-b1ef-81043381f427-1
00:03:08.657 --> 00:03:11.160
Application insights.

271b4fe1-eccd-4a2a-abd2-182ce2c1cc8b-0
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.131
So I say the if you're having any issues
with the API,

271b4fe1-eccd-4a2a-abd2-182ce2c1cc8b-1
00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:23.927
the 1st place to go is go to this
application insight and have a look the

271b4fe1-eccd-4a2a-abd2-182ce2c1cc8b-2
00:03:23.927 --> 00:03:26.040
keyword authentication.

206bd69a-23a0-4e50-8a57-7a4f7b10a852-0
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.440
Is there any specific account we need to
use it or do you have access to it?

6f9ba225-8908-439a-92da-d66df0355837-0
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.680
Personal account.

3c8d3871-67e9-4b1d-b68b-39d28041eadb-0
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.720
So, so for example, app service, yeah,
have its own identity.

5bc63576-049c-4b4a-af8e-ed25793f635f-0
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.278
So if you go to settings identity,
so you can see say it has its own

5bc63576-049c-4b4a-af8e-ed25793f635f-1
00:03:49.278 --> 00:03:53.640
identity system assigned identity, OK.

59d590e8-3bc4-48a5-9c80-72811eec2f98-0
00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:03.021
And if you go to keyboard,
so you can see keyword has this access

59d590e8-3bc4-48a5-9c80-72811eec2f98-1
00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:06.880
policy thing access policies.

c68cf003-47c2-4559-8a55-b8e48aefe9fe-0
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.320
So you can see that web app have access
to this keyword.

de0ae6f2-b46c-448f-85f0-b2efd2a1dcd4-0
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.680
So it has the secret permissions to it.

3146ab97-c3f5-4ee0-a4a7-3a03d9b27c64-0
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.880
And you can see myself and Pradeep has it,
so I'll while I'm at it,

3146ab97-c3f5-4ee0-a4a7-3a03d9b27c64-1
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.960
I'll let you do it.

67421e83-deb1-427e-8a5f-66b364c02edf-0
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.400
So if you so you you'll be able to add it.

86c15dea-b925-4145-90e6-3eb4878fdc6c-0
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.720
Is it?

c792cc24-fa8c-4ada-86dc-08517788a103-0
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.560
Yeah.

8ce2c8f1-263d-40bb-ac36-1341d305e6ce-0
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.320
You don't want any diver to do it?

a3e2e2b0-1e7a-44a1-aaf8-50e249628583-0
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.520
No, No, you don't.

9d2c1f68-2d2b-4565-bc69-335d2d6bc151-0
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.600
You don't need to do it.

1be2c59f-8445-482b-a102-8cf17649c818-0
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.920
OK, you can do it.

174e7a98-d2df-41e2-b990-7fc12f1d26f0-0
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.840
Secrets next.

f6ff39fd-2988-4579-99bc-a8e53b6a8dfd-0
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.480
So this one, now what's your account?

5a3854e6-9c75-4c34-bd44-6db2cbe1d4bd-0
00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.520
This is the account, right?

96672635-effd-4025-93fe-b6263256e85c-0
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.120
3467, yeah, yeah.

5cf4f2a7-e02c-48f1-8213-af303621fd36-0
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.400
So it'll be the account,
not your normal account.

cb9c84a2-d8c2-426e-9674-53641bb27718-0
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.800
Need to be added.

7ccbd27c-cc23-4604-8d74-36e5c7eddc73-0
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.800
Yeah.

09cf4b3d-6bd2-444d-88da-1ae3e69e9805-0
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:21.187
So now you should have access to this
keyboard and if you go to the secrets tab

09cf4b3d-6bd2-444d-88da-1ae3e69e9805-1
00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:25.480
here under objects,
these are all the secrets.

f2873a53-60d2-45e0-a885-cdf380bbdf33-0
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.520
So.

b90d6bf1-617c-4713-9c3f-1af19b922ed1-0
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.732
So normally when you ask for app
registration, the Azure team,

b90d6bf1-617c-4713-9c3f-1af19b922ed1-1
00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:36.280
they put credentials here.

6ef31181-3901-4093-9aa9-6698f825dad2-0
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.294
So this is the first one is the app
service for the Web API to connect to

6ef31181-3901-4093-9aa9-6698f825dad2-1
00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:46.640
Databus Yep.

c30deedc-0595-456f-a83d-7ac1644a1ef8-0
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:55.720
And this is the app registration for B to
C to connect to API.

19ef621c-375c-4be0-9a7e-8b30105b2c7c-0
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.760
And this service app registration is used
for deployment.

9a1bec2d-451a-4dd9-ab9a-cb4c6f3cc27c-0
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.942
So when so I mentioned that the policies
and content and everything get deployed

9a1bec2d-451a-4dd9-ab9a-cb4c6f3cc27c-1
00:06:09.942 --> 00:06:11.600
from the pipeline Yep.

6cdeb72b-659a-49aa-a4e8-143f9401385d-0
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.680
So it uses this app registration to
connect.

d086147b-65dd-4714-ade7-e07e6d411a4a-0
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.737
So if any app registration request,
then we need to ask do you you I don't

d086147b-65dd-4714-ade7-e07e6d411a4a-1
00:06:22.737 --> 00:06:24.640
think you need anything new.

c475e6ec-629d-4133-8c14-4e18b86e7e96-0
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.400
So yeah,
everything is already provisioned here.

80fa2e18-8e45-41db-b785-d1b464d9f387-0
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.040
So OK, app IDs and secrets are here.

b29c431f-10d6-4ee3-abf1-c7c3f9c973dc-0
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.720
So if you go here,
so you can see the app ID.

7eb844fc-6d2e-4025-aeb4-fd3a1dba881c-0
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.840
So this is the app registration that we
use to connect to for the automation.

b2839cac-38b6-4603-8d29-45596c27e46f-0
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.212
All right,
So basically for the Web API you created,

b2839cac-38b6-4603-8d29-45596c27e46f-1
00:06:44.212 --> 00:06:50.400
this is mainly for linking that B to C
user to the databus contact, is it?

ccbea9a4-379c-46f0-8cda-2caf4c2fb26c-0
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.200
So there is two things right from B to C
to yeah, other things as well.

db05a40e-5c72-46c5-92b1-c612ab59e121-0
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.853
So the first thing it does is so when
when the RN is entered,

db05a40e-5c72-46c5-92b1-c612ab59e121-1
00:07:05.853 --> 00:07:08.760
it goes and verify the RN Yeah.

dab5d679-cefe-4c8f-b2ce-77afe7d2375f-0
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.680
So if you go back to the.

f8c79451-6383-4de2-a8b0-92db8c7092a7-0
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:29.086
API itself on the screen so you can see
so impacted individual have few endpoints,

f8c79451-6383-4de2-a8b0-92db8c7092a7-1
00:07:29.086 --> 00:07:32.200
so verify is 1 endpoint.

b0305d06-48dd-4411-9f20-21d53523e69d-0
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:40.389
So that's just purely get the RN and date
of birth and find the contact and return

b0305d06-48dd-4411-9f20-21d53523e69d-1
00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:42.560
the contact ID, right.

19213c4a-c46e-4f58-8385-2af9c07d6173-0
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.640
So that that's what it does.

56dff501-e253-4c53-96fc-85a8e9d3ddc7-0
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.200
And then there's also another endpoint
called link.

de260662-a24b-4d41-b641-269812ebb319-0
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.200
So what link does is what you just
mentioned, right?

224aafde-c81b-40de-87eb-c2ade0530fa6-0
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.755
So it goes and build the link between the
BTC 2 database,

224aafde-c81b-40de-87eb-c2ade0530fa6-1
00:07:56.755 --> 00:08:00.840
BTC GUID and the contact GUID right in in
database.

4e467504-6305-46bf-887c-e42d8bf525b0-0
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.840
And also there are couple of other
endpoints.

48886e58-86fd-4c86-9974-69d026b31f04-0
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.360
One endpoint is to update the email
address.

fbde0bc2-05d2-4c26-9487-fdd39035cc65-0
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.213
So, so,
so there's also so So what what happens

fbde0bc2-05d2-4c26-9487-fdd39035cc65-1
00:08:15.213 --> 00:08:18.600
is when the email address is verified,
Yeah,

fbde0bc2-05d2-4c26-9487-fdd39035cc65-2
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.440
email address is used as the primary
email, right?

946f554e-95b4-434e-9b86-4eb0d743e820-0
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:22.560
Yep.

799c6355-adf7-4593-a92d-5b1200f45aea-0
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.920
And then the emails are getting shifted.

cc42241a-195d-41cf-a41d-75030dd45ae1-0
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.000
So if there's already a primary email,
then that becomes secondary.

d4a436bc-396c-4e09-8475-9816f242de1e-0
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.200
So that logic lives in the update email.

7da533ef-259d-438c-8059-b261f5dd9005-0
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.284
So if they are using a primary email ID,
signed up with B to C and then in CRM,

7da533ef-259d-438c-8059-b261f5dd9005-1
00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:41.680
if they are changing the email ID,
what will happen?

eb77eca8-6fa6-4036-af02-f870fe71f5df-0
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.840
Do we have any logic?

3be8cc0d-9d1f-4bb3-a48f-5d068cd10a03-0
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.280
No, we don't have that, right.

c791d3f1-98ee-4497-a1e4-0d33291d16d9-0
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.480
So that's something maybe you guys need
to implement in the future, right.

959fb714-ec62-4cfb-b086-695510497b2d-0
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.987
So, so yeah,
or we are not allowing them to modify the

959fb714-ec62-4cfb-b086-695510497b2d-1
00:08:51.987 --> 00:08:52.880
primary email.

508fbb27-b25b-479a-8cb7-7392811987d4-0
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.560
That's right.

dcf370f8-5479-49b1-b8de-9fea744b3cb4-0
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.701
Yeah, we're not doing that now,
but we may have to do it in the future,

dcf370f8-5479-49b1-b8de-9fea744b3cb4-1
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:56.960
right?

eb039344-a154-4f5f-87f8-e9a75d76afbf-0
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.760
So, so currently it's only one way.

660768c4-58f7-4ceb-8d62-730be0876189-0
00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.280
So yeah.

bd9bea79-0d31-4d7c-9c2a-ea8371428cb8-0
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.840
So it only get set during sign up.

0e11f251-50ea-4485-9937-299b94086098-0
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.728
So whatever the login email address gets
set as primary and the other email

0e11f251-50ea-4485-9937-299b94086098-1
00:09:06.728 --> 00:09:08.360
addresses get shifted down, right?

a73eee96-b4da-4eb4-b26a-429a6b5b5e59-0
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.600
Yeah, same goes for mobile app, right.

a057038a-d24e-4ec3-adcf-9d4b39e6b849-0
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.280
So once the MFA is done, yeah.

87ac6c63-0f34-40d9-b1f5-06793e466f0b-0
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.221
So we set the mobile number as a primary
mobile number and shift all the other

87ac6c63-0f34-40d9-b1f5-06793e466f0b-1
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:21.280
mobile numbers down.

f3f68241-985d-49d7-8c70-c3c4215276e6-0
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.600
OK, Yeah.

c4d5b2ac-c7e5-4069-9634-5c542efa7f48-0
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:30.409
So those endpoints are there,
but I'll maybe another day I'll talk

c4d5b2ac-c7e5-4069-9634-5c542efa7f48-1
00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:35.880
through we'll need to add more endpoints
for RMA.

84b99ce1-2cf7-4908-ad7f-9b570e689cc7-0
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.480
So, so these two thing Danica,
it's from the B to C screen.

8c171712-6beb-46cf-8d38-48ff174a7f1a-0
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.080
You're talking about change email,
change phone number or in CRM.

ee8aff1f-0afb-43e2-8289-5fa28b2a69ee-0
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.800
I mean my power pages you're talking
about.

4f75d75e-9c6b-4ed7-bfa2-76d328ec101b-0
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.160
No, no, no,
it's from it's from these screens, right?

8c23a6c1-811e-4f88-8267-9905af1058fb-0
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.400
So it's from the B to C screens, right?

b06c6dba-fbc4-4961-b1e0-01d3ce47e501-0
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.520
Yeah, that's what I want to Yeah.

d545a730-d525-4743-9229-175abee93504-0
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.308
So,
so when they verify the email address and

d545a730-d525-4743-9229-175abee93504-1
00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:06.280
hit sign up, Yeah, right.

869faed4-92dc-4167-897a-70cc22923a93-0
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:15.907
So what the B to C back end will do first
still we'll call the verify endpoint and

869faed4-92dc-4167-897a-70cc22923a93-1
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:19.560
verify the date of birth and ARN.

c6d646b1-dc5b-40f4-80ff-64777c8b21d0-0
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.400
Yeah, ARN, right.

45f4ecf3-a7cf-4072-ae4c-80f33ce4873c-0
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.960
And brings back the contact ID to B to C,
Yep.

b3af9f06-680d-4938-bf83-95318e8dbdee-0
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.600
So then what B to C does is B to C will
create the user in the B to C, OK, right.

bfe6d501-4a32-4488-9a1f-36f5772a0f83-0
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.360
So once if,
if the AR contact is ARN is valid, right?

8970a0fc-aa57-4c0f-93ca-61d61057193b-0
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:34.920
Yes.

48941031-03b5-4ecc-8a1f-1cbd82773752-0
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.125
So once the new contact the user is
created,

48941031-03b5-4ecc-8a1f-1cbd82773752-1
00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:45.480
the next thing for B to C to do is update
the email address, right?

9c45c24f-1abd-444d-b318-46e74a6e7f7d-0
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.520
So it'll update the email address as the
primary email address.

278efdd6-efea-4222-a216-30ea7043bc21-0
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.640
And then the last thing for B to C to do
is go and create the link.

d0745574-e79c-47fc-9f72-6fbf1a6a1255-0
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.720
Yeah, between contact and B to C Yeah.

dde410e4-f92b-41b3-8bfb-ae4279cb7c3f-0
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:03.162
So that all happens after clicking this
button in the code behind, right,

dde410e4-f92b-41b3-8bfb-ae4279cb7c3f-1
00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.560
B to C That's it.

7c41b762-14a3-4ebe-babe-eb86dc1cac53-0
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.720
It's a custom coding link.

52887e27-cfc5-4c0e-a879-d4329156346a-0
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.760
It's a custom coding, right?

f6a193c5-ee0d-461c-8eb9-e07728dc45fa-0
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:07.880
Yeah.

497039ea-250c-41f5-99ad-ac044a92bbfe-0
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.920
The B to C policy will call Bang, bang,
bang.

690c6f83-7076-46ef-b2f1-01102e448234-0
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.760
These orchestrate these events in
sequence.

2ec9e001-d95d-4114-b861-588ec3620209-0
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.360
Yeah.

33cdf6a3-c179-4368-be18-90769b5aee7a-0
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.680
And then next screen last for MFA.

b41b5bcb-b4bc-464e-87db-36d69596a25b-0
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.003
So once the MFA is verified,
so when you go to the next screen,

b41b5bcb-b4bc-464e-87db-36d69596a25b-1
00:11:25.003 --> 00:11:30.160
so once it's verified,
it'll call the update mobile endpoint.

eb59c37a-1551-4a98-9b2d-4fdfefa8798e-0
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:31.280
OK.

ba402860-bdd0-47b0-8fe6-e20cce73a10d-0
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.640
It, it is from these three screens,
not from Portal.

2c85859f-976d-42ad-a94d-22b804dd4e4e-0
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.480
Yeah, got it.

89e50ebf-8b18-4271-902b-6781f5c383c1-0
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.960
Yeah, Portal side,
we haven't done anything right.

7acb86bc-7eb1-4250-87d6-0ded13d876d1-0
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.731
So,
so this is where the user profile change

7acb86bc-7eb1-4250-87d6-0ded13d876d1-1
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:49.760
email address and mobile update mobile
will come into play.

1d637776-6b59-40d7-83ac-43e9cdfb37c7-0
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.080
So you can call the you can have a
separate policy.

1c6adc83-ecb3-4ee5-ab77-9e854d74093c-0
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.261
And so I,
I think the way that we sort of decide we

1c6adc83-ecb3-4ee5-ab77-9e854d74093c-1
00:11:57.261 --> 00:12:03.613
thought that would happen is so there
will be a link in the profile page to go

1c6adc83-ecb3-4ee5-ab77-9e854d74093c-2
00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:08.760
and update the login email address or the
mobile number, right?

74c148af-0a55-4203-acc2-7409e1d2c1f6-0
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:15.140
So that link will redirect user to B to C
and B to C will show a change email

74c148af-0a55-4203-acc2-7409e1d2c1f6-1
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.640
address field and a change mobile number
field, right.

bacb3def-9f94-4a36-84dd-a7d9e70290e8-0
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:27.076
Once they change the B to C back end,
similar to the sign up,

bacb3def-9f94-4a36-84dd-a7d9e70290e8-1
00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:30.200
we'll call these APIs, right?

6681e58a-19b9-47ee-a6c8-429fc0460b59-0
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.960
OK, Yep.

67e8c391-83fe-4b1a-ad15-fa77ee10acb8-0
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.127
And we'll go and change the mobile number
and the email address after changing it

67e8c391-83fe-4b1a-ad15-fa77ee10acb8-1
00:12:37.127 --> 00:12:37.880
in B to C.

8b3a0973-7486-4498-a840-2bf2bd5ab68d-0
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.480
So B to C is sort of considered as the
source of truth for the primary mobile

8b3a0973-7486-4498-a840-2bf2bd5ab68d-1
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.520
number and primary email ID.

664b0827-f9c7-4cb9-9232-4f373fcb0506-0
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.402
So so I think Jamie agreed to not to
allow changing the primary email address

664b0827-f9c7-4cb9-9232-4f373fcb0506-1
00:12:53.402 --> 00:12:55.480
and mobile number from CRM.

c438e199-74da-4cb9-9483-dd74c53819a0-0
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.360
So it it will always be a self service
thing.

b4879424-4b95-4397-9ad1-a00c2551a930-0
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:06.264
So user will need to log in and change
the change the login email address and

b4879424-4b95-4397-9ad1-a00c2551a930-1
00:13:06.264 --> 00:13:09.680
the mobile which is not implemented right.

91c0d86f-cb38-4043-8f4f-5cfbff073049-0
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.000
So this is something probably you guys
need to implement later down the track.

501b6c98-4373-4ab2-aaf2-1ccb9d68b12f-0
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.736
So we're so we we're on click of this
create button in the BDC screen how the

501b6c98-4373-4ab2-aaf2-1ccb9d68b12f-1
00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:26.760
code is LinkedIn the Azure back end yes.

cbc2808d-8f70-4cfe-8a95-2ca049e512ac-0
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.880
So let's get to that then.

cd7fcdac-261f-4d3b-84ef-022476a4a8f1-0
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.397
So, so you can see so,
so as I mentioned in the other

cd7fcdac-261f-4d3b-84ef-022476a4a8f1-1
00:13:36.397 --> 00:13:42.600
yesterday's session,
so this is the starting point, right?

9afed88a-ce24-486e-bb1a-6bf8bd22de92-0
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.120
Yep, sign in sign up policy.

a4e0e06b-ef26-47ac-aefd-b675cd55fd66-0
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.840
So this is what renders the those screens
I shared before, right?

0e985582-6a01-4c24-8425-aaa134e1ebe8-0
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.680
So this sort of the starting point.

adae7125-b5ff-4350-b899-283ff31c6cb7-0
00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:00.920
And you can see, as I explained before,
policies sort of have a hierarchy, right?

4eb371b8-5897-48fe-973f-0bdcc075ae03-0
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:07.680
So this is the, the sort of like the,
the top level, the derived class.

e276020f-0c6c-4e08-b813-1291177c4e5e-0
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.960
If you, if you, if you think about it,
right?

e2d6ead4-81ce-449f-a24b-391f04287ce2-0
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.440
So you can see there's a base policy.

66292e59-8553-4d7a-98de-575c6b016b6c-0
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:14.760
Yeah.

6e0d806d-706f-4c06-8a04-75073dd87dbd-0
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.520
And you,
you can see a default journey here, right?

a403b243-eb2a-4f37-b1a4-14fe70c32ae2-0
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.680
So the BDC has this journey concept.

1d7bfd36-1c40-4d9d-98cb-07072789e67a-0
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:29.840
So all that is a sign up journey,
sign in journey and passive reset journey.

bbdc09ed-9171-4119-8483-dcf4e7261d50-0
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.640
There are journeys, right?

5e9c4a11-2582-4598-815a-b26474249f8b-0
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.320
So journey consists of different steps.

37831148-1335-439f-872d-e637f0e308e2-0
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.840
So let's go to, let's go and find this.

9f42058c-0bb4-4a64-9d6d-2336263e18f5-0
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.232
So, so,
so if you find the policy that you start

9f42058c-0bb4-4a64-9d6d-2336263e18f5-1
00:14:42.232 --> 00:14:45.274
with,
and then the next thing to look at is,

9f42058c-0bb4-4a64-9d6d-2336263e18f5-2
00:14:45.274 --> 00:14:47.640
yeah, this is the extension policy.

bc44f259-96b7-4310-9aac-076702e94819-0
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.360
And extension policy you need to look for
the journey.

8a22a6e5-538f-41bd-ae40-68bef7c23715-0
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.400
So here.

fae30294-1852-42d7-98f8-64b91874de51-0
00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:03.280
So if I go to so you can see a user
journey, right?

0a8f6c72-4fcd-4d9e-a81e-d5e3fedbc11f-0
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.800
Yeah, user journey is a bunch of steps,
right?

5966dee6-e59a-4ae9-a76e-795c8cb8abb8-0
00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.680
So you can see they're ordered.

35eee44a-5477-430a-93fe-b782b19dfb27-0
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:20.853
So first step in here is so you remember
that when we actually browsed the default

35eee44a-5477-430a-93fe-b782b19dfb27-1
00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:23.400
DNS, it was blocked, yes.

2643d1d3-f32c-477d-a0d6-f20f56df1791-0
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.880
And then we had to use the custom DNS to
access it, right?

4c88b8b1-7e76-4ec6-bf65-f29c268faa4e-0
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:33.640
So these first three steps are there to
handle that.

b3aad6d9-1ae0-43f8-af32-648ec7c5dad7-0
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:41.333
So just blocking the default DNS and only
allowing the custom DNS to access the

b3aad6d9-1ae0-43f8-af32-648ec7c5dad7-1
00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:42.680
policy, right.

f31b9d9b-605e-4266-936d-3cd3131ec1ce-0
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:53.684
And this Step 4 is you remember that we
had a requirement so so in in in the

f31b9d9b-605e-4266-936d-3cd3131ec1ce-1
00:15:53.684 --> 00:15:58.160
portal home page, we added sign up button.

49480cbb-16b0-4f4a-965c-73ecb4d91ff3-0
00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.240
Yeah.

46b6da3b-7d9d-47ad-96aa-74c359020a6a-0
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.976
So,
so that was done through a query string

46b6da3b-7d9d-47ad-96aa-74c359020a6a-1
00:16:02.976 --> 00:16:04.080
parameter, right?

6a188b12-9ee8-4977-9c99-2877dc7432ee-0
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.000
So yes, correct.

353f5b92-5dea-4004-8fe2-3b1a5948ae76-0
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:05.840
Yeah.

d06273e2-8378-4242-a933-85b04131719b-0
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.680
So what portal did was it added the
additional query string parameter.

aac79cd2-d308-4c42-8513-b83026e73c14-0
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.440
So this is actually this first step.

b97aa0a8-d3e4-4228-873d-c0231bd3e938-0
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.480
The Step 4 is reading that query string
parameter.

e73d6a13-cc84-4b15-98d2-a0dc8cbca84c-0
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.751
OK,
so we are passing some written URL or

e73d6a13-cc84-4b15-98d2-a0dc8cbca84c-1
00:16:19.751 --> 00:16:21.080
something as well, right?

ff1f39d8-9c7a-4e51-ac69-e9299d7c3f4e-0
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.440
Yeah.

9a29e3a0-de52-4933-ba36-f32d94608fd2-0
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.040
So that that's it's default B to C
behaviour, right.

0553ddb6-638a-4056-a26c-dcce5c06fcdb-0
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.520
So B to C behaviour from B from there,
see.

61ec2553-e26a-4f6b-aa55-219153f80e3c-0
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:35.920
So you can actually see what actually
happens here, like if you go to this here.

f8baa356-2283-401c-8598-23dbb40d74ef-0
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:53.773
Yeah,
so it's pretty much reading options

f8baa356-2283-401c-8598-23dbb40d74ef-1
00:16:53.773 --> 00:16:55.520
parameter.

40bdf4a3-1ed1-4b46-b748-388186c01c27-0
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.680
So I think we named it as option option.

0f3a3878-38da-43b7-b9df-6b7bb314bce2-0
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.640
And so,
so there's a claims transformation.

c706c7a9-66c9-41d3-b73c-dbc5aa9199d4-0
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.832
I, I,
I think I probably won't dig deep into

c706c7a9-66c9-41d3-b73c-dbc5aa9199d4-1
00:17:07.832 --> 00:17:08.160
this.

f638a173-8671-4ab7-84b1-d12cecdd7934-0
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.946
This is more if I dig deep into it,
we're going down the B to C sort of nitty

f638a173-8671-4ab7-84b1-d12cecdd7934-1
00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:16.600
gritty path, right?

8530678d-ba6b-41ef-9071-96d4e1669f06-0
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.498
OK, yeah,
it'll be too much information for you

8530678d-ba6b-41ef-9071-96d4e1669f06-1
00:17:19.498 --> 00:17:19.800
guys.

ab99bdb4-7f60-4b9e-b3e6-161820dac285-0
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.440
I'll, I'll keep it high level.

5e05cf95-e69b-4b7b-8eda-3317c7cd738f-0
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:30.246
So this is pretty much checking whether
the option is there and then if the

5e05cf95-e69b-4b7b-8eda-3317c7cd738f-1
00:17:30.246 --> 00:17:32.000
option is there.

df56e1c5-53d9-40ef-a10a-454919134a4a-0
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.922
So,
so these are sort of like for each step

df56e1c5-53d9-40ef-a10a-454919134a4a-1
00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:37.560
there are preconditions.

2aa45d7e-0a0e-467e-9b4a-6d6a0643bd18-0
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:45.840
So you can say if this precondition is
false, then skip this step, right?

a6b79525-e07b-4600-93f3-a8b53f260560-0
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:53.149
So this this pretty much says if the URL
has the sign up flow,

a6b79525-e07b-4600-93f3-a8b53f260560-1
00:17:53.149 --> 00:17:58.720
just go directly to the the sign up
journey, right?

2824ad17-1a9e-442b-991d-9701fc5d91bb-0
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.120
And yeah.

c807dca8-66b3-4966-af56-a3aa313f96a1-0
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.788
So if it is not there,
then go to we'll start from the sign in,

c807dca8-66b3-4966-af56-a3aa313f96a1-1
00:18:10.788 --> 00:18:11.320
right?

e399e37b-ab40-4ed9-9946-1797fbc208ae-0
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:16.353
So that means that you get you'll have
the sign in screen displayed and you have

e399e37b-ab40-4ed9-9946-1797fbc208ae-1
00:18:16.353 --> 00:18:18.280
the sign up link at the bottom.

327cd4e9-7348-4e58-bcf6-0868d69532ff-0
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.466
But you can direct directly get
redirected to the sign up page if that

327cd4e9-7348-4e58-bcf6-0868d69532ff-1
00:18:25.466 --> 00:18:29.960
option URL present query string parameter
presenting the URL.

da859fa8-0307-481d-af8c-0935bf005922-0
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:37.320
OK, and then so OK, so now let's go to.

3ce381fb-d43c-4c9a-8dda-71ebf5e635b7-0
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.080
So let's say that we've landed in the
sign up, right?

8a7c290d-950f-444c-baad-944d06fcca88-0
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.440
So let's see what's the sign up does
right?

2f5af674-a470-46a0-9d3f-15debc828102-0
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.569
So,
so this is this this screen pretty much

2f5af674-a470-46a0-9d3f-15debc828102-1
00:18:51.569 --> 00:18:58.400
so that that that output claims renders
this screen, right?

9f820962-b5f7-4d0d-9004-d93036c1adaa-0
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:04.791
So if you go back to it,
so you can see output claims,

9f820962-b5f7-4d0d-9004-d93036c1adaa-1
00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:12.346
you can see email address,
email address need to be verified and it

9f820962-b5f7-4d0d-9004-d93036c1adaa-2
00:19:12.346 --> 00:19:13.680
is required.

52d70054-8c50-4a15-9fa7-fddd46415543-0
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.303
And there's the password message and then
the new password need to be entered,

52d70054-8c50-4a15-9fa7-fddd46415543-1
00:19:19.303 --> 00:19:22.160
password need to be reentered to confirm.

ccecd08a-217e-4637-ae74-04b757d6fc20-0
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.840
So that's, that's all that sign up page,
right?

2e2614b4-d7bf-4af4-9f3c-68ac3f02de07-0
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:36.425
And then the ARN message,
ARN field and date of birth field,

2e2614b4-d7bf-4af4-9f3c-68ac3f02de07-1
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:42.400
that's all the sign up controls, right?

09bb473a-e81f-4119-8710-bcc151a5d0b6-0
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:55.256
And so so this is that bit that I was
talking about where B to C calls the Web

09bb473a-e81f-4119-8710-bcc151a5d0b6-1
00:19:55.256 --> 00:19:56.880
API, right?

45713b6a-ff4e-4c21-9815-c7ba61991165-0
00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:57.920
The press.

d745bc4a-40c1-48d0-af75-d4f8b382637f-0
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:04.721
So so we say so after so so this is the
this is the bit that get run after

d745bc4a-40c1-48d0-af75-d4f8b382637f-1
00:20:04.721 --> 00:20:09.320
hitting that create button,
sign up button, right?

9e7e52dc-191d-48a9-b977-56cec3ed933d-0
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.960
So it says go and get the access token
first.

f5bfa0a6-a91a-4a83-b8df-d0d460b74a1d-0
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:23.707
And then call verify endpoint and create
write the B to C user into the B to C and

f5bfa0a6-a91a-4a83-b8df-d0d460b74a1d-1
00:20:23.707 --> 00:20:26.480
then then create a link.

68a2bf51-0126-43c7-88ce-665cc0a82f2c-0
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.146
OK,
this this this is this is that

68a2bf51-0126-43c7-88ce-665cc0a82f2c-1
00:20:32.146 --> 00:20:35.880
orchestration piece of code.

c23fd26d-1142-4dc9-b779-219b806f95af-0
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:41.120
OK, so this reference ID,
you put it here where we are getting it.

ebfe8fc6-3036-4b08-a5a0-47615f529576-0
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:48.163
Call API to verify you have some mapping
or is this the name of the code like the

ebfe8fc6-3036-4b08-a5a0-47615f529576-1
00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:52.800
rest get the reference IDs,
the highlighter reference IDs.

d31152a9-4bfc-48eb-9733-92831f2df644-0
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.440
How we are getting this reference ID
where we are mapping this?

74d69a73-8c9d-43c6-ad1d-6e658ac91b56-0
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.800
This is the mapping reference ID.

3d0eb405-d0a9-4216-861f-db2f7addf380-0
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.880
You mean this one here?

12463148-47ac-4fcf-91ad-d4a21437435c-0
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.600
Yeah.

662614bc-9d41-4676-a31c-a334843a5873-0
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.080
So getting the access token.

9cd824c8-f78b-4334-b8d4-c994545b32da-0
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.000
So if you deep dive into the access token
so you can see it's.

9a7fcfd7-0e2d-4901-933a-4c0a8e786b24-0
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:20.840
So what it does is it calls the Azure ID
or two endpoint to get the token.

4d7f146a-52bc-4317-b9cc-a37552bc10eb-0
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.160
So this is getting replaced right from
the SMSI mentioned before.

ff4fee95-ff95-4ec7-99e9-647d64414132-0
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:32.240
So this is coming from the config right?

84860e04-6881-47ad-a490-43be65a403a7-0
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.560
So tenant ID is coming from tenant ID.

b40ac577-103d-47cb-9624-dade157d2d69-0
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.400
Is this right?

7cf19179-73d8-4db0-8973-762bb08f329e-0
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:52.568
So so that GUID get replaced here and you
can see it reads the username which is

7cf19179-73d8-4db0-8973-762bb08f329e-1
00:21:52.568 --> 00:21:57.440
the client ID and the secret.

9715e77c-178b-432f-942d-b4dbc30fc945-0
00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.160
This is what I showed yesterday, right?

58b1dce0-3209-43f2-87db-662380b1cf4c-0
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:08.080
So if you go back to the,
you go back to B to C.

4fdbfd28-7f90-45f7-b7b6-02beb140ed0f-0
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.790
Go back to.

ee47ce98-859b-407c-b7a6-5bfabed42e69-0
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.950
Maybe I'll go to test.

0e500d86-2c84-4b8c-b845-a82fe52a212c-0
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.510
Test is clear.

c6adcc68-e99d-4374-89a7-faeba0576ccb-0
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:08.760
You're going to the B to C so you can see.

beb9fe71-16f9-414d-ac3e-b54f1237fb25-0
00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.000
So you need to get the client ID and the
secret right?

2cf91b37-fd00-4fa4-8e2a-080a3feebfb0-0
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.080
So client ID and the secret is read from.

1c851124-9e03-4c62-8fcc-3c91dee06d37-0
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.440
Remember the policy keys.

5a8c30b1-0afe-4cb9-8123-8b25a83308c8-0
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.360
So policy keys hold the client ID and the
secret.

98851a4e-5328-4963-8cf4-692c8ca2209d-0
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:33.690
So what it does it is it gets the client
ID and the secret and call this token

98851a4e-5328-4963-8cf4-692c8ca2209d-1
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.720
endpoint and that token endpoint returns
access token to.

6621f93b-97a7-460f-845f-02a3bf4672e6-0
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:52.480
Access token is saved to as a claim and
you can see if I go to all API to verify.

4d1dafa0-f798-4d2b-ad36-831d35f4a31d-0
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.840
So this this is this is our endpoint,
right.

e3a581cc-f768-4409-b981-bc4c952ba72c-0
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:04.686
So the second thing to do is call the
verify endpoint and use the token as the

e3a581cc-f768-4409-b981-bc4c952ba72c-1
00:24:04.686 --> 00:24:08.760
authentication header so BTC can
authenticate.

3100fd7e-e453-4d71-b08a-43433dbe66d9-0
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.480
It's basically a mapping the XML where
and what to get it.

7a07a49d-9378-42d0-8cf3-b7153b791af5-0
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.320
Yeah, right.

f2dc1965-e89b-4b06-968a-7ff390d69eee-0
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.606
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's it's its own programming crappy

f2dc1965-e89b-4b06-968a-7ff390d69eee-1
00:24:17.606 --> 00:24:19.520
programming language yeah.

e9ecbee9-c2a1-40fc-916d-01ea387c9fa8-0
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.720
And which is XML based.

488e7877-5ecc-4003-bdcb-f88f1a1a3ebf-0
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:32.238
This is all going to change in so B2 CS
already deprecated so you can't create

488e7877-5ecc-4003-bdcb-f88f1a1a3ebf-1
00:24:32.238 --> 00:24:34.960
new BTC tenants anymore.

65f71de0-4c64-44dd-9522-d9f737d25c60-0
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:44.800
So it's been sort sort of what do you
call lifetime has been ended.

75e63447-9502-498c-8d84-427863623a9a-0
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:50.377
So there's,
there's a new thing called new technology

75e63447-9502-498c-8d84-427863623a9a-1
00:24:50.377 --> 00:24:52.960
called external inter ID.

cf942926-c408-46d7-adcb-3867d0a8d0b2-0
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.280
The B to C is replaced with external
inter ID.

225ab96b-c683-4680-b3d2-ac659ff2f4a8-0
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.840
So are we going this B to C to prod or
not?

1fd94d44-a528-465e-9104-9d139d674897-0
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:07.520
Do we we going because Pradeep needs to
get the because external inter ID is new.

5f5bb064-3bc7-44b9-b9c5-2089d135143a-0
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.280
So it's needs approval from DUA to for us
to use it.

534b702e-f232-4af6-842c-b8c1c7ec5366-0
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.360
So that takes time.

fecfa158-17c1-4649-a7b5-ebe58be19d1a-0
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.797
So,
so we got three years to use B to C but

fecfa158-17c1-4649-a7b5-ebe58be19d1a-1
00:25:18.797 --> 00:25:23.720
after three years we have to push the
mark the new one, right?

e43783e5-65de-41c0-8ad1-53bc1c82c949-0
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.160
Yeah.

e2d85444-2306-4bfb-a98b-a962da4157e3-0
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:24.840
And then live.

a5b445b5-e410-4dfa-bdb2-a0485e9bfe7c-0
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:26.880
Yeah.

ccb9ffca-5630-47b7-9be6-87b8b6c7b627-0
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.280
This need to be converted into intro ID.

34e77e31-5acc-4b12-b454-84f8163c0e88-0
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.400
So that doesn't have this crappy XML
language.

0e091061-1eca-4f55-b94d-519ce2e764eb-0
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.080
It's it's more API driven.

6efbb3f5-a2ca-4956-945b-f6df5b58b99c-0
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.080
OK, yeah.

0e6c169e-1b89-4f86-86cf-d86313394eb4-0
00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.783
So anyway,
so that's how you sort of navigate

0e6c169e-1b89-4f86-86cf-d86313394eb4-1
00:25:45.783 --> 00:25:47.840
through the policies.

3e9517c7-542d-459e-afdb-93ca95498b40-0
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.570
So,
so the place to start is the user journey

3e9517c7-542d-459e-afdb-93ca95498b40-1
00:25:54.570 --> 00:26:03.404
and then so depending on the claims,
some steps get skipped like for example,

3e9517c7-542d-459e-afdb-93ca95498b40-2
00:26:03.404 --> 00:26:10.880
if you're doing a signing in,
then sign up step will get skipped.

51ce91cc-808e-4004-9f84-a7e48eff3fe1-0
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:20.680
Or if you're directly browsing from the
using a URL with a query string parameter,

51ce91cc-808e-4004-9f84-a7e48eff3fe1-1
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:28.344
then also the some of the steps are
skipped, so this is this is again,

51ce91cc-808e-4004-9f84-a7e48eff3fe1-2
00:26:28.344 --> 00:26:37.412
this is if you're coming from the sign in
screen and hit the sign up link so you'll

51ce91cc-808e-4004-9f84-a7e48eff3fe1-3
00:26:37.412 --> 00:26:38.600
get landed.

ed0722da-e603-4f06-9a11-d3e0b5965bd1-0
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:45.040
It uses the same function you can think
of as a technical profile.

9534c1af-5cd3-4bb4-ae99-d20cdf9fc637-0
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:55.000
As a function it uses the same technical
profile as what I showed before and after

9534c1af-5cd3-4bb4-ae99-d20cdf9fc637-1
00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.760
sign in or sign up,
it reads the complete user.

ffd154c3-fd58-4492-befa-157ebd7db417-0
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.840
So so object ID.

c7c25c66-8ddb-486c-beb3-462b98f22b9e-0
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.520
So you can see object ID in many places
right?

8c319624-81ef-4fe3-b41f-e38a6cdf8781-0
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:13.880
So object ID is the ID of the user,
that GUI that we linked to the contact ID.

d8f7a0af-5f5b-4e58-9c64-c81e49dff1b1-0
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.680
So we didn't have B to C in the B to C,
Yes, OK, yeah, yeah.

d1f03a2b-bbab-4568-a50f-3c59dc61a534-0
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.680
So it uses the object ID to read the
complete user again.

a741bf39-be39-4b87-a201-1cc0c24a8e3a-0
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:33.982
And so this user verification step is I
think we're going to get rid of it in,

a741bf39-be39-4b87-a201-1cc0c24a8e3a-1
00:27:33.982 --> 00:27:38.720
in RMS so that this user verification
step is there.

01862ead-dcb5-4bbd-a331-a62bab11d2e4-0
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.045
For example,
if the user goes through sign up and when

01862ead-dcb5-4bbd-a331-a62bab11d2e4-1
00:27:44.045 --> 00:27:48.560
they presented with MFA,
they leave without doing MFA, right?

e42920cd-9eff-44c5-8f3b-e45e481b8a87-0
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.958
And because by the time you get to the
MFA screen,

e42920cd-9eff-44c5-8f3b-e45e481b8a87-1
00:27:52.958 --> 00:27:58.800
your user account is already created,
you you'll have a username and a password.

b439843e-74bb-43a5-ad8c-0e6df32268a6-0
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.840
So you can log in, right?

c09c0908-9b28-4654-a865-b98602b65c22-0
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:06.120
So because they haven't created the MFA,
so we added the additional security step.

8c011c96-4ac5-4e03-b784-65cc57fedc0f-0
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.405
If they log it,
try to log in without doing completing

8c011c96-4ac5-4e03-b784-65cc57fedc0f-1
00:28:11.405 --> 00:28:15.452
the MFA,
we'll ask the ARN and date of birth again

8c011c96-4ac5-4e03-b784-65cc57fedc0f-2
00:28:15.452 --> 00:28:22.040
and then get them to do the force them to
do MF MFA set up if they try to sign in.

5a772f84-d9c2-4295-9e3e-2db90bfa68b7-0
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.720
OK, Yeah.

5348000c-9c60-43d9-8956-bd9064cbd01f-0
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:29.717
But I don't know,
you might not continue with that because

5348000c-9c60-43d9-8956-bd9064cbd01f-1
00:28:29.717 --> 00:28:34.037
like for example,
RMA RTO sign up doesn't have any

5348000c-9c60-43d9-8956-bd9064cbd01f-2
00:28:34.037 --> 00:28:36.240
additional cheques, right?

1668d974-1166-4a6c-b314-a1f1c23aa696-0
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.120
Just the RN?

be9a930d-84ef-4770-afbd-50c8ad3f2a24-0
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.280
Yeah, you might not do that, Yeah.

fc811eb8-6e93-4e62-a8fc-c263f632857d-0
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.480
So the next step is, hey,
before you move on to the next step.

028a4fe5-5605-437b-8e3f-b851b5634a54-0
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.280
Sorry, Tinuka.

d0e2d443-c5cc-414b-aa17-26aaf52c6c43-0
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:47.600
Yeah.

482d200b-92f8-4b67-94fc-01245aa98d58-0
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.760
So these XMLS, right,
do they get generated when you create the

482d200b-92f8-4b67-94fc-01245aa98d58-1
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.375
policy like default and then you
customise on top of those ones or you

482d200b-92f8-4b67-94fc-01245aa98d58-2
00:28:56.375 --> 00:28:58.000
just create from scratch?

6f999e67-c808-4834-ad31-935ad655c214-0
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:12.898
These XML files create from scratch,
but there there is a good repo B to C

6f999e67-c808-4834-ad31-935ad655c214-1
00:29:12.898 --> 00:29:21.000
samples GitHub yeah, this this repo here.

7b7e9005-958d-4a1b-8aad-1e359f3cbbe5-0
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.320
So I'll put a link into this chat.

1a5078e0-12f5-4021-a6a6-58a54e05b2e0-0
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:32.140
So this has like so many policy examples
for many different scenarios,

1a5078e0-12f5-4021-a6a6-58a54e05b2e0-1
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.720
right There is this this sort of examples?

41694684-eabf-448e-b885-347e60f45e53-0
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.220
Yeah,
this least like the your go to place the

41694684-eabf-448e-b885-347e60f45e53-1
00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.640
the documentation is crappy.

efbe133e-722f-4304-bcb9-133f90800449-0
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.160
So if you wanna do something,
you start from here.

9dfe2d25-8809-49db-8aaa-fd9e08844bf2-0
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.720
OK, So once you create these XMLS, right?

43d81785-2bcd-4c5e-8041-f773b3d33fef-0
00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.360
Yeah.

ac36eb70-21af-4e82-b0fa-5b3f47945d3b-0
00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.960
How do you link with the policy in Azure
portal?

26a44faf-705c-436b-b3ca-6045c860051e-0
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.053
So these are like you,
you work on your local,

26a44faf-705c-436b-b3ca-6045c860051e-1
00:30:07.053 --> 00:30:10.000
you have it on your Visual Studio yeah,
repo, right.

dfb6447d-9264-4d3b-a835-29675afe8a03-0
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:10.480
So yeah.

43e5c90f-4ecb-465b-b2b2-e5dbbe0a0cb1-0
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.804
How do you link these ones with the
policy that you create like or how do you

43e5c90f-4ecb-465b-b2b2-e5dbbe0a0cb1-1
00:30:14.804 --> 00:30:16.800
link the policies into Azure portal?

f0488f42-8d18-4a9d-b54a-f24122910fd2-0
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:17.880
Yeah.

e6ff2c4c-1d70-4ab7-82b1-4c14dd5e7a2b-0
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:27.263
So you upload the policy like for example,
say if you go to custom policies,

e6ff2c4c-1d70-4ab7-82b1-4c14dd5e7a2b-1
00:30:27.263 --> 00:30:30.920
so and then you can upload it.

f63258b2-aeda-4673-8bff-5af728f3c4a6-0
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:38.960
OK, so you to XML, OK,
but make sure that you don't.

d1ec0714-7d2b-40bb-ae50-e122908ffb85-0
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.480
So there's two folders, right.

e6cc0ba1-b06d-4687-92cc-3a169efce3a1-0
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:48.480
So as I said, so they are policies with.

96a04462-ef5c-4755-bde2-1f9b1692ded5-0
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.560
So at the road level,
the policies are with placeholders, right.

2b2a7173-44c5-469b-babe-06382fbe3f72-0
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.296
So it won't accept those policies like
for example,

2b2a7173-44c5-469b-babe-06382fbe3f72-1
00:30:58.296 --> 00:31:01.120
if I try to upload this policy.

75a118ef-d32b-4d64-b1c1-f384ecdd5fdf-0
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.000
Yeah, right.

26ab8a5b-16fb-4638-8e5a-079a2daec3e6-0
00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.880
So you can because it's only they existed.

44fba293-d52f-483b-b97d-115577357d33-0
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:12.051
And then there are it says like there's
something called config tenant name,

44fba293-d52f-483b-b97d-115577357d33-1
00:31:12.051 --> 00:31:14.000
which I don't know, right?

a15c0230-b391-4528-a575-991437d3e10e-0
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.320
You need to always up compile it first.

ab9371e2-7b6f-4ca4-9e53-5f929fe2336f-0
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:22.880
Yeah, OK,
The compiled version is always in in the

ab9371e2-7b6f-4ca4-9e53-5f929fe2336f-1
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.000
environments folder and then upload it
from there.

5721322d-6b36-4133-a9e9-3f2f18ab5c4f-0
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:28.840
OK.

4d744c2a-f9b3-4d97-93e2-90813e9e9444-0
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.120
It is used like this upload.

18deeae5-7705-4211-9c34-732382770537-0
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.840
That's a good validation, right?

e5f38537-611d-4519-a702-80c196550a1a-0
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.080
So, so you can see that there was error,
right?

6f014448-7206-4dd4-9320-842351361e3c-0
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:41.480
Yeah.

25d511f8-a877-49fe-817e-38bf631185bf-0
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:51.000
So it'll tell you that if your policy
have issues, OK.

051d12c8-8003-43ae-b782-9727b3014d36-0
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.092
So when you compile these variables that
you have defined on the XML will be

051d12c8-8003-43ae-b782-9727b3014d36-1
00:31:57.092 --> 00:32:00.566
replaced with the corresponding
environment name and then it gets

051d12c8-8003-43ae-b782-9727b3014d36-2
00:32:00.566 --> 00:32:01.040
uploaded.

bc005e14-c39f-4e82-8e04-87e794428c7e-0
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.200
OK, that's right.

106df9e4-80a0-409e-bbb1-201919f25a63-0
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.840
So that that was the command I was
showing the other day.

71f294d7-a109-4578-978e-3d6c65b07cbd-0
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.440
Yeah, this command here, right.

66e9ccb2-4aa9-4dbc-838e-a67275704586-0
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:12.475
So this command the prepare B to C
policies one when you provide environment

66e9ccb2-4aa9-4dbc-838e-a67275704586-1
00:32:12.475 --> 00:32:15.845
name, yeah,
compile it and put it into the

66e9ccb2-4aa9-4dbc-838e-a67275704586-2
00:32:15.845 --> 00:32:18.040
environment policies folder.

a0b0bca8-96e5-4fd6-91f2-9afa4d246222-0
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.720
So which is which is the one need to get
uploaded to B to C?

94de3189-0b2f-4224-9592-3684b5000874-0
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.308
If you do,
we have reference of these commands

94de3189-0b2f-4224-9592-3684b5000874-1
00:32:29.308 --> 00:32:35.653
somewhere stored in the report or like
you don't have something,

94de3189-0b2f-4224-9592-3684b5000874-2
00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:38.679
these ones have secrets, right?

88d6646d-4843-4d83-ba08-a6346b72c91c-0
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.840
So we don't put anything with secrets in
here.

557fefa8-bb6b-43d9-9c90-e6865c98641e-0
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:50.789
But if you create some high level
document then you just hide that,

557fefa8-bb6b-43d9-9c90-e6865c98641e-1
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:52.680
but you can mention it.

a59719d7-2c94-4d2a-b5fe-ea94072653e9-0
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.120
This needs to be a secret because we
don't know these comments at all.

42bb7758-2247-445d-89fc-b89f4636f76d-0
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.753
So yeah,
but but these commands are only needed

42bb7758-2247-445d-89fc-b89f4636f76d-1
00:33:00.753 --> 00:33:02.760
for your local development, right?

e6e4fc44-3799-49e9-8689-5e0b5d4cb41c-0
00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.160
So, yeah,
we are not getting a planning for it.

537a6de8-5dba-4c44-a413-6bd201caed1e-0
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:11.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can maybe.

b6cc550f-65d2-4f2f-8dd4-c2709db1ada9-0
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.214
OK, I'll, I'll,
I'll think about how to yeah,

b6cc550f-65d2-4f2f-8dd4-c2709db1ada9-1
00:33:17.214 --> 00:33:19.920
how to document these commands.

69a77fdb-7e2b-42e3-9443-d31dad9b2f2f-0
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.461
Yeah,
that local development commands for you

69a77fdb-7e2b-42e3-9443-d31dad9b2f2f-1
00:33:23.461 --> 00:33:29.389
guys to sort of running because I mean
these all the secrets are coming from

69a77fdb-7e2b-42e3-9443-d31dad9b2f2f-2
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:31.160
keyboard anyway, right.

1a3170de-c72f-4a8c-a2e1-ea6dc5f0d330-0
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.785
So,
so I can put keyboard references so you

1a3170de-c72f-4a8c-a2e1-ea6dc5f0d330-1
00:33:34.785 --> 00:33:40.800
can read the keyboard and put the command
together and then then run it.

7687cd3c-fb9d-475f-b003-e6407c620052-0
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.080
Yeah, sure.

b4d39340-f426-4573-8f3c-10e9cd17740b-0
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:43.960
Thanks Tanuka.

0b3eb85e-dd98-424b-90c5-fa9daed9d95c-0
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:52.960
And and one other thing was that so if I
go to here, this is the compiled version.

50d9effa-c6d6-422b-bc80-56b8a34840e6-0
00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:04.920
So you can see the policy can be run as
in development mode.

642ee348-de5a-496a-8780-7908d7708c75-0
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.800
So which is also helpful, right?

1b042ed1-eb37-4faf-a891-2e6f2821dc7d-0
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:14.214
So when you're debugging your policies,
so you may not have validation error,

1b042ed1-eb37-4faf-a891-2e6f2821dc7d-1
00:34:14.214 --> 00:34:18.080
yeah, but your policy still could fail,
right.

10b35ff1-bd2b-48fb-a646-68e60dbafec7-0
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.840
So,
So what I've done is there's the

10b35ff1-bd2b-48fb-a646-68e60dbafec7-1
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.760
development mode.

f111d98b-ffa6-42cd-ae33-270ef9a05634-0
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:28.216
And if when you put policy into
development mode,

f111d98b-ffa6-42cd-ae33-270ef9a05634-1
00:34:28.216 --> 00:34:33.200
you can configure application inside
logging.

d8b8129c-4046-4602-a0fb-f93063ca9bc8-0
00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.360
So whatever the I'll maybe let's let's do
that.

2c374e7d-5805-42f6-87cf-669e95914da6-0
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.120
Let's do a.

7678ca89-12ae-4c7e-87de-a5fb45a50fbb-0
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.640
It's going to be the C.

852fc2de-79ec-4a5a-be67-309f370817e6-0
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:17.540
It's new their portal it's to sign up in
dev.

b1f85143-9c73-4e1f-aec7-ea3fd82a0fbd-0
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.360
Yeah, let's verify the email address.

881f6c59-5794-4cfa-90ae-cf18e3e5609a-0
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:58.600
Hopefully this I'll use my email address.

d333dcf0-ccb5-48f1-8e38-7270e516bfa7-0
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.880
And verify my email address.

d59661b5-ae8d-4287-aedb-84e840f5d61b-0
00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.840
So we'll get a email soon.

99d998f1-79e7-4214-ac82-13806e20a9cd-0
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.810
How you're sending that email then?

274550e2-04cf-493f-86fa-967ba600b16d-0
00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:46.170
OK, that's Microsoft.

88ec571c-7ae9-4451-9c61-f14ae40456b2-0
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.890
So we're not we don't have any custom
email providers or anything like that.

644e01c4-1fde-4c6d-8d8c-12f6e2d33c5d-0
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.210
It's just out of the box.

4a633195-a153-436a-b895-f445f386bd5c-0
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.290
So from Azure you can connect to Exchange
Server and then send it.

9ab9812d-f033-4e9d-b5bd-9f9570eee6bc-0
00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.930
Is it or you have like templates that you
send it?

10a15971-a88a-49b3-b77f-e8b0e6fa9937-0
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.941
No,
the I mean out of the box 1 doesn't allow

10a15971-a88a-49b3-b77f-e8b0e6fa9937-1
00:37:03.941 --> 00:37:05.520
you to do templates and stuff.

476a20ee-8d6b-4667-8f8c-67bf3462f459-0
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:10.920
It just gives you just vanilla OK
template.

5dcfdbc4-423d-4b16-98a6-aa0cc6225be9-0
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.223
But if you wanna do custom template
custom emails,

5dcfdbc4-423d-4b16-98a6-aa0cc6225be9-1
00:37:14.223 --> 00:37:18.240
then you need to have like send grid or
some custom provider.

d14a25b6-5eb9-429a-bf6b-2bf48d1a43c5-0
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.880
But we haven't gone down that path.

dbbd3166-d46d-4a09-942f-c5970c17ac2e-0
00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.800
We just use out of the box speak email
email service.

3df446d3-9e21-4745-b307-c38d61ea26b9-0
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.775
It's like an API you call and then it
sends the email to the No BTC does all

3df446d3-9e21-4745-b307-c38d61ea26b9-1
00:37:28.775 --> 00:37:29.080
that.

ee1e6d6a-920d-4824-b207-158a032c63ca-0
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.773
OK,
that that remember that in the policy

ee1e6d6a-920d-4824-b207-158a032c63ca-1
00:37:34.773 --> 00:37:36.760
that we had MFA?

540f9235-11ba-4cfe-92e1-1852ec45cea8-0
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:43.606
Yeah, step, yeah, that step that's all,
all sending and verifying all that is

540f9235-11ba-4cfe-92e1-1852ec45cea8-1
00:37:43.606 --> 00:37:48.040
done by B to C We don't have call any
additional APIs.

9831743b-d3b0-4cb0-b1ec-3a3b1646b954-0
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:16.564
Let's put password and let's put a
invalid random stuff,

9831743b-d3b0-4cb0-b1ec-3a3b1646b954-1
00:38:16.564 --> 00:38:24.820
random date of birth &amp; up.

9fbb0812-553d-40e1-8007-b1ef58be241d-0
00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.780
So now this will fail.

0aa00d5d-8430-421e-8424-97f31e8088bb-0
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.280
So what I'm going to show you is what
actually happened.

be25c0e0-0717-4708-8775-c51310a05af9-0
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.160
So it's not a valid DRN.

b629e67a-efa1-4b2c-a787-43202b63fff3-0
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:58.730
So if you go back to Azure and
Application Insights, go search,

b629e67a-efa1-4b2c-a787-43202b63fff3-1
00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:08.560
maybe it would last 30 minutes,
might take some time.

246d4490-bf38-418e-ae52-0cabadb5e894-0
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:17.040
So you can see these are logs from B to C
so you can see.

14ed0e7f-e470-475d-856e-9f30928d1658-0
00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.880
I mean I wouldn't deep dive into it.

97a0e919-46c1-4882-bed3-ce10b1d28c24-0
00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:27.360
You need B to C understanding to figure
out what's wrong and what's going on.

c3af75c4-4c22-46ce-957f-348beaecf9a0-0
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.640
But the logs are here.

532ef482-1194-4998-a0ae-6156549d8364-0
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:35.840
So if you know B to C what you've learned
B to C, you can find the logs here.

41335556-0ba6-4174-b4a9-21d7d0c1dc4f-0
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:43.200
And also you should see the API logs.

9eeb13ec-4800-45eb-aae0-717c976d9a7f-0
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.360
Might take a couple of minutes for the
logs to come through.

25ed5fa4-85d5-48fc-ba45-c42f309f9716-0
00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.240
These logs are enabled in prod also.

1008302b-1fab-40fc-86cf-5ad785cfc779-0
00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:03.153
Yeah, OK,
it's but it it it has different log level,

1008302b-1fab-40fc-86cf-5ad785cfc779-1
00:40:03.153 --> 00:40:03.800
right?

2764365c-6504-4d25-a543-5a432fb87d8b-0
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.760
As I showed you before,
it doesn't have the development mode.

b2820453-0540-4920-bbfc-c80ea7a7a1c7-0
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.320
It has production mode.

a61ea96c-daad-4f22-bb13-f0f021d93bae-0
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.120
So you you won't see the these traces.

5f06db72-5c93-4e8c-8c41-b177d93c0fa0-0
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.680
You can't get to this this level of
detail.

eddd7c5a-1854-409b-86fe-792f35e95bcd-0
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.880
But any errors it will log.

ba78abc6-89bb-42ac-8ea3-40826d684147-0
00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.040
OK, so you can see.

57610dc0-175f-486b-8312-df30b2a38f72-0
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:32.080
There's, if you go to one of these, right,
you can see verify fared with 400.

8a4974b3-94ce-463c-aaf4-c2cc5b4150d1-0
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:43.857
You can see it called the IT called the
database ARN table yeah endpoint and it

8a4974b3-94ce-463c-aaf4-c2cc5b4150d1-1
00:40:43.857 --> 00:40:49.537
returned 400 the the API itself written
400,

8a4974b3-94ce-463c-aaf4-c2cc5b4150d1-2
00:40:49.537 --> 00:40:58.119
but the erm code was successful because
it was just squaring right.

67412cdd-0b96-4cb4-bcff-7d11b2332439-0
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:05.571
So it was just yeah,
you can see so you can see what what it

67412cdd-0b96-4cb4-bcff-7d11b2332439-1
00:41:05.571 --> 00:41:07.160
actually did.

05cbfb01-08e5-48a5-a725-0ec2931fa1dc-0
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:14.560
So this is this is the actual database
code that the API made.

e55433d2-b18f-4435-9ec7-c5bee61f40e0-0
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.520
So you can you can fully debug.

d810f9a7-ace9-4a6c-bfd4-727bd57b7c5e-0
00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:23.440
So you can write your custom log entries
as well.

a96494d6-d055-4006-945e-711f0e4a21c7-0
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.520
Custom log entries will appear in the
Application Insight as well.

9aaa27fa-16b8-4b46-a1c3-4f778fdd1792-0
00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:35.299
So, so any,
any issue with so you can see there's a

9aaa27fa-16b8-4b46-a1c3-4f778fdd1792-1
00:41:35.299 --> 00:41:39.909
failed request,
any issue with authentication,

9aaa27fa-16b8-4b46-a1c3-4f778fdd1792-2
00:41:39.909 --> 00:41:47.460
the first place to go is Application
Insight and come here and check whether

9aaa27fa-16b8-4b46-a1c3-4f778fdd1792-3
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.520
there are any errors.

57eddd1a-bdc5-40f9-ae13-74ac81075cde-0
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:55.310
And yeah,
so you can see an exception message

57eddd1a-bdc5-40f9-ae13-74ac81075cde-1
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.240
written by the API.

002d12d3-c126-4e1b-b27c-48b2d83af653-0
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:04.503
And yeah,
so you can see the verify codes like if I

002d12d3-c126-4e1b-b27c-48b2d83af653-1
00:42:04.503 --> 00:42:06.920
go to production now.

ca090b02-d5f9-42f9-a761-85f1030e2909-0
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.960
So this this is because we have this is
not a real error.

6e51aef3-a3e1-43fd-9e35-7bb7681bf854-0
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:32.612
It's it's it's returning four O 4 because
it's it in in in production,

6e51aef3-a3e1-43fd-9e35-7bb7681bf854-1
00:42:32.612 --> 00:42:36.080
we have keep alive setting turned on.

0a627d99-4e58-46d7-9de0-5b3891f9df47-0
00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.917
So what,
what when the keep alive setting is

0a627d99-4e58-46d7-9de0-5b3891f9df47-1
00:42:38.917 --> 00:42:41.920
turned on,
it doesn't let the API go into sleep.

83461ec6-63d4-4763-95a9-30d339cde292-0
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:49.920
And so the Azure keeps pinging it and
that ping end point returns four O 4.

cf30d080-e0ca-44fb-9a0f-de6fc505462b-0
00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.560
So that's why it's, it's,
it's showing 404.

f8b04ca5-9789-4f01-9fa1-bc64ab2ba162-0
00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:58.411
But so in in low environments,
we don't have keep alive setting turned

f8b04ca5-9789-4f01-9fa1-bc64ab2ba162-1
00:42:58.411 --> 00:43:01.486
on,
but in production we do because we don't

f8b04ca5-9789-4f01-9fa1-bc64ab2ba162-2
00:43:01.486 --> 00:43:03.400
want the API to go to sleep.

6d89d06c-5a8b-433e-8881-796ce9d1632e-0
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:19.160
And then BDC calls to sort of time out
last 30 minutes.

bc2fe72d-4769-4afb-9d9b-c3147fa869b4-0
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:23.440
No one use the API, no one signed up.

58f0dc25-2075-40ab-8a84-1856a95bc68e-0
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.640
It'll be 24 hours.

23559bf2-d429-4227-ad58-253efc1cd637-0
00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:34.120
Yeah, it's you can see this,
you can see the sequence as well.

579bfc57-27e8-472f-989a-86fa7956df9f-0
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:49.960
You can see the verify happens 1st and
then that person linked and.

7e124791-23f9-4735-96b8-4baf84228273-0
00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:01.080
The next thing is they've done the MFA,
yeah, things like that.

63fdba1d-38d6-44f2-905b-f3ae89d1ff61-0
00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.960
So you can really we can figure out.

9d2c508c-160b-4bd2-84ce-fc9b861c0b17-0
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:11.051
So you can also see so who signed up so
which you can get the contact guide if

9d2c508c-160b-4bd2-84ce-fc9b861c0b17-1
00:44:11.051 --> 00:44:15.720
you have issues,
then you can track it back to CRM.

c5dafa12-95d8-4971-9b7c-ed1ad866467b-0
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:22.240
And also so there's a Microsoft.

6ef93e29-44f1-411a-8d13-ff6c0ef26602-0
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.440
So you can see there are 717 exceptions,
right?

b270e1b5-87ae-4fb7-a585-d2cd8bd6908e-0
00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.480
Let's go to exceptions.

e562fdff-70be-460e-92f3-22a6fb810b7b-0
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:34.279
Now that's you can philtre,
you can say I just want to look at the

e562fdff-70be-460e-92f3-22a6fb810b7b-1
00:44:34.279 --> 00:44:35.560
exceptions.

068c6ec3-a3a9-432e-a40a-b10dbd9e391f-0
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
So these exceptions are fine, right?

686a9c16-180a-4186-bc4e-792e06c5aed3-0
00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.160
So someone already signed up trying to
sign up again.

541007d5-a838-4517-9356-9d5ff24d4bf5-0
00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.280
So which is a valid error.

9f22b3db-93a8-42da-80e7-e82f2a0710a9-0
00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:57.160
This is the era that we're investigating.

8bc94435-3612-4d9f-a5ec-70bcd6950f5e-0
00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:05.760
This era is intermittent and I don't
think it's impacting individuals.

9de5145a-60eb-466c-a64f-46322fdc673a-0
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:15.228
So what something for you guys to note is
any exceptions logged by B to C,

9de5145a-60eb-466c-a64f-46322fdc673a-1
00:45:15.228 --> 00:45:19.840
it will be under B to C_A RIGHT, and?

1242429a-6879-4f3a-9a44-8ef978ecf157-0
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.920
Correlation ID IS the most important
thing so.

08883612-97e7-47b1-b10e-2f7addd82bd0-0
00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:30.240
When you get the correlation ID YOU,
can go into the B TO CB TO Co SO.

5eae8f85-b58f-4341-895e-b21ac2c7e006-0
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:35.800
These are all custom policy logging right,
today's?

920b001b-cb30-435d-9758-6df95b6be7fd-0
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:41.440
Also another set of logs which I DON'T
have access to Pradeep Have access so.

c28a10f6-28d1-447b-b08f-134131be81c3-0
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:48.962
You can go pick the correlation ID AND go
query those logs like the audit logs &amp;

c28a10f6-28d1-447b-b08f-134131be81c3-1
00:45:48.962 --> 00:45:53.298
in logs,
they they're B to C out of the box logs

c28a10f6-28d1-447b-b08f-134131be81c3-2
00:45:53.298 --> 00:46:00.024
in in in in B to C So Microsoft is
currently investigating why this happens

c28a10f6-28d1-447b-b08f-134131be81c3-3
00:46:00.024 --> 00:46:04.361
time to time,
but seems like people can sign up,

c28a10f6-28d1-447b-b08f-134131be81c3-4
00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:05.600
no complaints.

cf10a70a-135e-4e32-84d8-3ad929727180-0
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.160
They're also struggling.

e783770c-1998-40e7-80dd-b0403ceccc7d-0
00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.800
What's going on with this exception?

1d4df7d0-cb59-4c18-b5df-03c881dffd82-0
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:20.286
Looks weird, but yeah,
I think that's pretty much the diagnostic

1d4df7d0-cb59-4c18-b5df-03c881dffd82-1
00:46:20.286 --> 00:46:21.520
side of it.

8b090817-6ee1-4049-be0d-3f6de83e4c4f-0
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.736
I'm sorry, Dinuka,
if you've already mentioned that,

8b090817-6ee1-4049-be0d-3f6de83e4c4f-1
00:46:26.736 --> 00:46:31.520
have you said like where we are enabling
once you create the policy, right?

c33bec4c-1596-4e4c-9b17-47b54b058472-0
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.440
How we are enabling these logs?

065f4f20-21c4-4265-8be7-d538b6a36afb-0
00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:40.050
Is there like when you create it,
it it by default Azure keeps a trace or

065f4f20-21c4-4265-8be7-d538b6a36afb-1
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:41.600
log of these policies?

bef5af9a-f06b-4138-84cc-18e53277ec66-0
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.960
Or do you have a specific area where you
go and enable it?

ca53be2a-4298-45e1-b6bb-a0318f6cb192-0
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.915
Yeah,
So enable it is where I showed before,

ca53be2a-4298-45e1-b6bb-a0318f6cb192-1
00:46:47.915 --> 00:46:48.240
right.

2d03f71e-8de9-48f0-b00e-db80441d0dfd-0
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.520
So if you go to the site, your policy,
Yeah.

f929bcbc-d75c-4be0-ba62-e59832ed144a-0
00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.040
So not, not not those base policies,
right.

99929355-8946-42cc-a7d8-49d55e364495-0
00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.680
Your root policy, OK, where you start.

7395b343-3a45-4341-950b-9d598b61311f-0
00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.880
And so there's this connection string.

d5a4cc3f-777d-4cc8-ab88-847927a78ee4-0
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.280
Yeah,
that's the application inside connection.

463b0c95-6b09-4085-bfb6-714e8b22db9c-0
00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.920
You need to configure the application
inside connection string here.

060b0258-0470-410c-ac53-73a7ad5efeb9-0
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:07.720
OK, OK.

44bd9af4-a3b6-42a8-b7b3-e90dbe7f2eba-0
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.160
So that links the policy and the
application inside.

18f70d26-e495-4738-9fbd-20101150270b-0
00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:22.624
And also this the the mode is also
important because that sort of determines

18f70d26-e495-4738-9fbd-20101150270b-1
00:47:22.624 --> 00:47:25.600
the level of logging, right?

0bb8ade4-0e37-4897-a481-ddb69080895b-0
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.941
So if you put it to development mode,
then you can see all the debug traces,

0bb8ade4-0e37-4897-a481-ddb69080895b-1
00:47:29.941 --> 00:47:30.280
right?

4d11be2d-156d-48be-8ae2-7d5842a1b9dc-0
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.120
So when you put it to production,
you only see exceptions.

3685e91b-92cf-4757-b1ba-c5c12e99d204-0
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.242
OK, yeah,
that that's that's why we can't really

3685e91b-92cf-4757-b1ba-c5c12e99d204-1
00:47:36.242 --> 00:47:41.085
get to the bottom of the those production
exceptions that those exceptions,

3685e91b-92cf-4757-b1ba-c5c12e99d204-2
00:47:41.085 --> 00:47:45.482
they don't happen in non prod,
but we don't want to put the policies

3685e91b-92cf-4757-b1ba-c5c12e99d204-3
00:47:45.482 --> 00:47:47.839
into development state in production.

91859c1f-c82f-4c07-b1e5-fa49d3cf780b-0
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.480
So we can't really know.

db6d1de5-a94d-4ffe-ab17-84d43c8b7b4f-0
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.875
We don't know where the exception is
actually is coming from because that that

db6d1de5-a94d-4ffe-ab17-84d43c8b7b4f-1
00:47:55.875 --> 00:47:58.880
looking at that exception,
that exception is useless.

f1622532-dae1-4a12-91a6-df723e0e18e3-0
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.040
It doesn't it doesn't say what happened.

6b365157-7090-4e84-8779-86c8eae07e8d-0
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.560
It just says an internal error occurred.

c1bc721e-9e72-4202-a8c4-3f657ed45be3-0
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.320
That's it.

8e5b898d-aaa3-431d-b1f0-cbea842840b0-0
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:12.706
So that's why we put it back to Microsoft,
which is have a look and let us know

8e5b898d-aaa3-431d-b1f0-cbea842840b0-1
00:48:12.706 --> 00:48:15.800
what's actually going on here,
because they, they should,

8e5b898d-aaa3-431d-b1f0-cbea842840b0-2
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.560
they should know what's going on.

0475b4c5-a4ff-4dfd-a6b7-52adc408f490-0
00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.962
You see, as I said,
the most important thing is the

0475b4c5-a4ff-4dfd-a6b7-52adc408f490-1
00:48:20.962 --> 00:48:21.760
correlation ID.

e86e5bd9-4f30-4df1-a5ad-59c3abd437fe-0
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.926
So we,
we provided correlation ID to the

e86e5bd9-4f30-4df1-a5ad-59c3abd437fe-1
00:48:26.926 --> 00:48:28.960
Microsoft, they can pinpoint it.

96b4eaa2-8b0c-4b20-ac84-907121ebe763-0
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:34.591
This exception,
can we not enable that to development

96b4eaa2-8b0c-4b20-ac84-907121ebe763-1
00:48:34.591 --> 00:48:41.571
mode for some time, capture the log in,
then turn it off because it's it's just

96b4eaa2-8b0c-4b20-ac84-907121ebe763-2
00:48:41.571 --> 00:48:42.880
sign in, right?

45f08dde-4f3f-4981-a3c2-683b5a65283c-0
00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.800
So we don't want to be logging PII data
into these logs, OK?

3aac32b3-1404-4f6d-bbe3-218c0790fb52-0
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.720
The, you know, date of births,
things like that.

f90665e8-5fab-429f-a791-03b5a5342f95-0
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.360
We we don't want that log logged into our
logs.

297f3faf-0340-48e8-8a9f-686c50a18331-0
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.560
So that's why I'm hesitant to.

42622d28-f5f3-4cfa-950b-4fcb4da3051d-0
00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:07.160
All right, yeah, enable the face logging,
OK.

a14c784b-a67e-4a30-9ed7-aa599d546e74-0
00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.600
What else?

87f8fc81-86d4-46f8-98e9-b541d5830db2-0
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:26.503
So we got the, went through the policies,
went through the logging and went to the

87f8fc81-86d4-46f8-98e9-b541d5830db2-1
00:49:26.503 --> 00:49:27.000
API.

cb5fecfb-93ee-4e80-ac17-2681961f65d4-0
00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.880
How do you configure the MFA in this XML,
Linuka?

89d62ad0-afbb-4201-98ea-9dac8f21a8c9-0
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:39.960
So yeah, yeah,
it's just B to C have these.

daa14c02-228d-4227-85d2-944a6fe0923f-0
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:51.400
So if you go back to that journey, right,
So user journey, it's good here.

7090775e-f542-425f-85eb-687a6a19dcf5-0
00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.360
So you can see.

06b47d9b-48c3-40c9-a3e4-a0ff407a585c-0
00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:06.520
So we read the user verification and this
is the one factor policy.

7e411452-b920-4b74-ace7-1bcf0765ea53-0
00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.640
So you can see if you go into it.

70f93bf9-79f9-469c-82b1-c423841b87e5-0
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.398
OK,
it's I think it's coming from a base

70f93bf9-79f9-469c-82b1-c423841b87e5-1
00:50:17.398 --> 00:50:19.080
policy, so it's not here.

cb287ed5-1f97-4080-a9f6-718a7c5c8e10-0
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:24.000
Let's look this one in.

f6296258-8f03-44b6-a786-af8d65ff7689-0
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.840
Yeah, So you can see.

d7b99f7c-c9e7-413c-8fbb-10b385db6490-0
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:35.440
Yeah.

b20d1eaf-a3a6-410d-bc2b-ec39c6d35a02-0
00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:47.062
So this is out of the box Microsoft MFA
OK provider and we've just used it pretty

b20d1eaf-a3a6-410d-bc2b-ec39c6d35a02-1
00:50:47.062 --> 00:50:47.720
much.

d873eed9-3f24-4335-9058-304b18f4b515-0
00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.520
So this is how we use it.

476f52a2-451f-4f9e-b055-8580540aad5b-0
00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.040
So that if you go.

5bc86fed-b3ba-437c-9a9b-37428b8226cf-0
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.880
So we basically enable that is anything.

8e408ff2-7b03-4b39-b5d7-db518a47d6d2-0
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.600
Yeah, that's it.

b13f3ae4-d667-48ef-b7af-2aa51d7564e0-0
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.320
We haven't done any customization which
is enabled.

014245cd-6d47-4908-a31a-773d14da4d08-0
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.520
Yeah, it,
it just works just out of the box.

5a802f93-db2a-4b18-abe4-c60335a5248b-0
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:10.040
So when you created the user policy
itself, it will ask you to enable it.

6a6f775f-132c-4589-b455-13f6c4785e3c-0
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.080
Where where it will ask you to enable it.

34ff07f8-78e9-431c-ad90-cd28e05f6177-0
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.800
It's a user journey, right?

a00adb5a-3281-4500-b969-545a5a08ea65-0
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.560
Oh, user journey.

1f24b846-c53f-4440-9a56-e200069a0e15-0
00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.160
Yeah, in the user journey.

1d50ce41-cb31-462e-848f-6886bf2a32ce-0
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:21.120
So we've enabled,
we've said that use this profile.

07080a89-d440-46aa-8bfe-17ab4a7fdcef-0
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.640
When we use this profile, it does the MFA,
ask for MFA.

e52547af-240c-457f-a99b-ebfaab36f104-0
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:26.760
OK.

6c51d243-64e7-4c68-abd4-93213e0534fa-0
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.680
That's how it pretty much works.

fa94e8e7-97f8-4149-b85d-e0598dc03172-0
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:37.246
If there is any issue,
if the user doesn't receive the code,

fa94e8e7-97f8-4149-b85d-e0598dc03172-1
00:51:37.246 --> 00:51:37.640
yeah.

bc202ccc-944a-4fab-a3d5-c88c9b691917-0
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.277
How do we,
how do we handle that like debug it or I

bc202ccc-944a-4fab-a3d5-c88c9b691917-1
00:51:42.277 --> 00:51:47.040
don't think we can handle it unless if
you see any errors.

68dab5e0-5f1f-4f90-97e6-5b746b165a1f-0
00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:52.600
So I think the first place to start is
look at the BTC logs, right?

700f8440-ad94-489e-9cdd-110538ca9399-0
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.920
If you find error or something, yeah.

0501d155-761c-44f0-bc1b-23570ffd4ee3-0
00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:03.118
Otherwise, raise a support ticket, OK,
with Microsoft because because we we it's

0501d155-761c-44f0-bc1b-23570ffd4ee3-1
00:52:03.118 --> 00:52:04.600
not our implementation, right?

19a22302-ce4d-4612-8b25-303b865488ce-0
00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.160
It's yeah, Microsoft implementation.

900af975-0f6a-4381-bfbd-e8c9fd5eff51-0
00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.320
And Microsoft that's sending the text and
verifying it.

2b54623e-cf30-4d7f-95dd-b239d7cc1792-0
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.200
Yeah, that's all done by Microsoft.

85a2d3a3-b5c9-4c25-a855-03efae525b1c-0
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.200
You don't do it.

865d959f-bcba-4cd3-971d-ea5effb58b91-0
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:13.960
OK.

3c7f89b4-cfb3-4c76-b683-fc85c355d369-0
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:22.520
So any issue with the MFA,
I would go to Microsoft.

dc9b2d7c-5ae1-4b4d-a64f-b086338e968d-0
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.320
All right.

619b88fb-cbf7-466f-872a-3d8a3ac3afcb-0
00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:23.520
Yeah.

a57bf4d1-f393-4721-9268-102c40a1fa3c-0
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.720
It's been reliable.

7f44dc76-0670-4711-89c1-7b109b0692d8-0
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.880
I haven't seen any issues.

921eb44d-3c66-4322-8afe-47b80221ddc3-0
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:32.445
But if you see any issues,
I think just look at the logs and if you

921eb44d-3c66-4322-8afe-47b80221ddc3-1
00:52:32.445 --> 00:52:38.747
don't find it in anything, just raise,
get the Azure team to raise a support

921eb44d-3c66-4322-8afe-47b80221ddc3-2
00:52:38.747 --> 00:52:39.320
ticket.

4087134f-cbcb-4b56-94dd-db139cf02459-0
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:46.320
OK, yeah, I think we're up for time.

f54b2820-4147-4d22-9a3e-0ca4578dcb45-0
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.760
So I'm working on the dev end.

0902426c-a45c-4d01-920b-2bca85024710-0
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.800
So next,
next session we'll go about the

0902426c-a45c-4d01-920b-2bca85024710-1
00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:03.840
deployment side deep dive into the we
haven't gone to the pipelines yet, right.

76f25d12-252b-487b-a247-891c945e1c3b-0
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:11.888
So we'll deep dive into the pipelines and
how things get deployed and how the dev

76f25d12-252b-487b-a247-891c945e1c3b-1
00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:16.600
in this configured and we'll do some
debugging.

4ff1fdbd-8ffa-4076-99f0-52276d1bbfa9-0
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:28.280
And so I think pretty been pretty been
myself's going to race so so is there.

a1e30426-6b82-4538-873d-c60318b7f2dd-0
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:39.632
Devint app service is still not created,
so, so we,

a1e30426-6b82-4538-873d-c60318b7f2dd-1
00:53:39.632 --> 00:53:48.040
we see resource group environment,
but for Devint, we're going to share it.

a0d6d1c1-2656-43bf-b5ca-0139040ed6cf-0
00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.064
So,
so you can see there's a dev API and

a0d6d1c1-2656-43bf-b5ca-0139040ed6cf-1
00:53:55.064 --> 00:54:01.000
there will be another API here called
Devint and we'll use that.

c13a85bf-d4da-47bd-ae43-feb23044e9f2-0
00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.200
So it, it's a slightly different pattern.

1e94b2f2-0cd5-4454-bcd8-af1a4ebec138-0
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:10.603
So I'll next session I'll take you
through the standard pattern and then the

1e94b2f2-0cd5-4454-bcd8-af1a4ebec138-1
00:54:10.603 --> 00:54:12.600
sharing pattern as well.

6384b6bc-e08c-49b9-a776-b2c15ff37852-0
00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:20.680
Yeah, having will post for today.

a1a7d4e4-6f20-426c-9bff-2baa135c6f84-0
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:22.560
All right.
